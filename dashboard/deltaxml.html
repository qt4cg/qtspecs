<h1>DeltaXignia diffs</h1>
<main>
<p><a href="https://www.deltaxignia.com/">DeltaXignia</a> generously provide
an XML Compare license for use in preparing these specifications.
Where possible, this is used to produce a summery of the difference in
the HTML between the branch or pull request being reviewed and the
latest accepted drafts.</p>

<p>The pipeline that produces these versions has been modified slightly from the
stock pipeline provided by XML Compare.</p>

<ol>
<li>Any differences that are only changes in the ID value of an HTML anchor are
elided.</li>
<li>Any differences in SVG are elided. (Due to the way that GraphViz produces SVG,
these changes are almost exclusively related to different generated ID values.)
</li>
<li>The JavaScript that supports the “view” buttons has been rewritten.</li>
<li>New “previous” and “next” buttons have been added. These attempt to navigate
through the document from one visible set of differences to then next. Note that for
technical reasons, differences in the Table of Contents are ignored.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please let <a href="mailto:norm@saxonica.com">Norm</a> know if you
notice an irregularities or errors in the presentation of these
documents.</p>
