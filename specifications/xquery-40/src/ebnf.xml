      <head>Extra-grammatical Constraints</head>
      <p>This section contains constraints on the EBNF productions, which are required to parse
        syntactically valid sentences. The notes below are referenced from the right side of the
        production, with the notation: <emph>/* xgc: &lt;id&gt; */</emph>.</p>
      <constraintnote id="parse-note-leading-lone-slash" type="xgc">
        <head>leading-lone-slash</head>
        <p>A single slash may appear either as a complete path expression or as the first part of a
          path expression in which it is followed by a <nt def="RelativePathExpr"
            >RelativePathExpr</nt>. In some cases, the next token after the slash is insufficient to
          allow a parser to distinguish these two possibilities: the <code>*</code> token and
          keywords like <code>union</code> could be either an operator or a <nt def="NameTest"
            >NameTest</nt>
          <phrase role="xquery">, and the <code>&lt;</code> token could be either an operator or the
            start of a <nt def="DirectConstructor"> DirectConstructor</nt></phrase>. For example,
          without lookahead the first part of the expression <code>/ * 5</code> is easily taken to
          be a complete expression, <code role="parse-test">/ *</code>, which has a very different
          interpretation (the child nodes of <code>/</code>).</p>
        <p>If the token immediately following a slash
          can form the start of a <nt def="RelativePathExpr">RelativePathExpr</nt>, then the slash
          must be the beginning of a <nt def="PathExpr">PathExpr</nt>, not the entirety of it.</p>
        <p>A single slash may be used as the left-hand argument of an operator by parenthesizing it:
            <code role="parse-test">(/) * 5</code>. The expression <code role="parse-test">5 *
            /</code>, on the other hand, is syntactically valid without parentheses.</p>
      </constraintnote>
      <constraintnote id="parse-note-xml-version" type="xgc">
        <head>xml-version</head>
        <p>The version of XML and XML Names (e.g. <bibref ref="XML"/> and <bibref ref="XMLNAMES"/>,
          or <bibref ref="XML1.1"/> and <bibref ref="XMLNAMES11"/>) is <termref
            def="dt-implementation-defined">implementation-defined</termref>. It is recommended that
          the latest applicable version be used (even if it is published later than this
          specification). The EBNF in this specification links only to the 1.0 versions. Note also
          that these external productions follow the whitespace rules of their respective
          specifications, and not the rules of this specification, in particular <specref
            ref="DefaultWhitespaceHandling"/>. Thus <code>prefix : localname</code> is not a
          syntactically valid <termref def="dt-qname">lexical QName</termref> for purposes of this
          specification, just as it is not permitted in a XML document. Also, comments are not
          permissible on either side of the colon. Also extra-grammatical constraints such as
          well-formedness constraints must be taken into account.</p>


        <p role="xquery">XML 1.0 and XML 1.1 differ in their handling of C0 control characters
          (specifically #x1 through #x1F, excluding #x9, #xA, and #xD) and C1 control characters
          (#x7F through #x9F). In XML 1.0, these C0 characters are prohibited, and the C1 characters
          are permitted. In XML 1.1, both sets of control characters are permitted, but only if
          written as character references. It is RECOMMENDED that implementations should follow the
          XML 1.1 rules in this respect; however, for backwards compatibility with <phrase
            role="xquery">XQuery 1.0</phrase>
          <phrase role="xpath">XPath 2.0</phrase>, implementations MAY allow C1 control characters
          to be used directly. <note><p>Direct use of C1 control characters often suggests a
              character encoding error, such as using encoding CP-1252 and mislabeling it as
              iso-8859-1.</p></note></p>

      <constraintnote id="parse-note-reserved-function-names" type="xgc">
        <head>reserved-function-names</head>
        <p>Unprefixed function names spelled the same way as language keywords could make the
          language impossible to parse. For instance, <code>element(foo)</code> could be taken either as
          a <nt def="FunctionCall">FunctionCall</nt> or as an <nt def="ElementTest"
            >ElementTest</nt>. Therefore, an unprefixed function name must not be any of the names in
            <specref ref="id-reserved-fn-names"/>.</p>

        <p>A function named <code>if</code> can be called by binding its namespace to a prefix and using the
          prefixed form: <code>library:if(foo)</code> instead of <code>if(foo)</code>.</p>
      </constraintnote>
      <constraintnote id="parse-note-occurrence-indicators" type="xgc">
        <head>occurrence-indicators</head>
        <p diff="chg" at="2023-05-22">As written, the grammar in <specref ref="nt-bnf"/> is ambiguous for some forms using the
          <code>"+"</code>, <code>"?"</code> and <code>"*"</code> <nt def="OccurrenceIndicator">OccurrenceIndicators</nt>. 
          The ambiguity is resolved as follows: these operators are
          tightly bound to the <nt def="SequenceType">SequenceType</nt> expression, and have higher
          precedence than other uses of these symbols. Any occurrence of <code>"+"</code>, 
          <code>"?"</code> or <code>"*"</code>, that follows a sequence type is assumed to be an occurrence indicator, which binds to
          the last <nt def="ItemType">ItemType</nt> in the <nt def="SequenceType"
          >SequenceType</nt>.</p>

        <p>Thus, <code role="parse-test">4 treat as item() + - 5</code> must be interpreted as <code
            role="parse-test">(4 treat as item()+) - 5</code>, taking the '+' as an
          occurrence indicator and the '-' as a subtraction operator. To force the interpretation of
          "+" as an addition operator (and the corresponding interpretation of the "-" as a unary
          minus), parentheses may be used: the form <code role="parse-test">(4 treat as item()) +
            -5</code> surrounds the <nt def="SequenceType">SequenceType</nt> expression with
          parentheses and leads to the desired interpretation.</p>

        <p>
          <code>function () as xs:string *</code> is interpreted as <code>function () as (xs:string
            *)</code>, not as <code>(function () as xs:string) *</code>. Parentheses can be used as
          shown to force the latter interpretation.</p>

        <p>This rule has as a consequence that certain forms which would otherwise be syntactically
          valid and unambiguous are not recognized: in <code>4 treat as item() + 5</code>, the <code>"+"</code> is taken as
          an <nt def="OccurrenceIndicator">OccurrenceIndicator</nt>, and not as an operator, which
          means this is not a syntactically valid expression.</p>
      </constraintnote>
      
      <constraintnote id="constructor-op-brace" type="xgc">
        
        <head>constructor-op-brace</head>
        
        <p>In XQuery, there are two ways that the expression <code>element otherwise {}</code> could be parsed:
        it could be treated as a computed element constructor creating an element named <code>otherwise</code>
        with empty content, or it could be treated as an attempt to select a child node named <code>element</code>,
        returning an empty map if no such node exists.</p>
        
        <p>This ambiguity has been introduced in 4.0 as a consequence of allowing map constructors to be
        written without the leading <code>map</code> keyword. The ambiguity is therefore resolved to retain
        the XQuery 3.1 interpretation, constructing an element named <code>otherwise</code>.</p>
        
        <p>More generally, if an expression starts with the three tokens (<var>K</var> <var>N</var> "{"), 
          where <var>K</var> is one of <code>element</code>, <code>attribute</code>, 
          <code>processing-instruction</code>, or <code>namespace</code>, and <var>N</var> is an
          <code>NCName</code> that could be interpreted as a binary operator (for example <code>div</code> or
          <code>otherwise</code>) then the expression is parsed as a node construction expression,
          creating a node of kind <var>K</var> whose name is <var>N</var>.</p>
        
        <p>This ambiguity does not arise in XPath, which does not recognize computed node constructor
        expressions. However, in the interests of compatibility between XPath and XQuery, and to retain
        the option of adding computed node constructors to XPath in the future, XPath processors
        <code>should</code> reject such expressions as invalid.</p>

                <p>Lexical analysis may typically handle nested comments by incrementing a counter

      <note><p>The significance of complex terminals is that at one level, a complex terminal is treated as a single
      token, but internally it may contain arbitrary expressions that must be parsed using the full EBNF grammar.</p></note>
      </item>
      <item><p>Tokenization is the process of splitting the supplied input string into a sequence of terminals, where each
      terminal is either a <termref def="dt-literal-terminal"/> or a <termref def="dt-variable-terminal"/> (which may itself
      be a <termref def="dt-complex-terminal"/>). Tokenization is done by repeating the following steps:</p>
      <olist>
        <item><p>Starting at the current position, skip any whitespace and comments.</p></item>
        <item><p>If the current position is not the end of the input, then
          return the longest <termref def="dt-literal-terminal"/> or <termref def="dt-variable-terminal"/> 
        that can be matched starting at the current position, regardless whether this terminal is valid at this point
        in the grammar. If no such terminal can be identified starting at the current position, or if the terminal that
        is identified is not a valid continuation of the grammar rules, then a syntax error is reported.</p>
        <note><p>Here are some examples showing the effect of the longest token rule:</p>
          <ulist>
            <item><p>The expression <code>map{a:b}</code> is a syntax error. Although there is a 
              tokenization of this string that satisfies the grammar (by treating <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>
              as separate expressions), this tokenization does not satisfy the longest token rule,
              which requires that <code>a:b</code> is interpreted as a single <code>QName</code>.</p></item>
            
            <item><p>The expression <code>10 div3</code> is a syntax error. The longest token rule requires that this
              be interpreted as two tokens (<code>"10"</code> and <code>"div3"</code>) even though it would
              be a valid expression if treated as three tokens (<code>"10"</code>, <code>"div"</code>, and <code>"3"</code>).</p></item>
            
            <item><p>The expression <code>$x-$y</code> is a syntax error. This is interpreted as four tokens,
              (<code>"$"</code>, <code>"x-"</code>, <code>"$"</code>, and <code>"y"</code>).</p></item>
          </ulist>
        </note>
        <note><p>The lexical production rules for <termref def="dt-variable-terminal">variable terminals</termref>
        have been designed so that there is minimal need for backtracking. For example, if the next terminal
        starts with <code>"0x"</code>, then it can only be either a <nt def="HexIntegerLiteral">HexIntegerLiteral</nt> or an error;
        if it starts with <code>"`"</code> (and not with <code>"```"</code>) then it can only be a
          <nt def="StringTemplate">StringTemplate</nt> or an error. <phrase role="xquery">Direct element constructors
          in XQuery, however, need special treatment, described below.</phrase></p>
        <p>This convention, together with the rules for whitespace separation of tokens (see <specref ref="id-terminal-delimitation"/>) 
          means that the longest-token rule does not normally result in any need for backtracking. For example, suppose 
          that a <termref def="dt-variable-terminal"/> has been identified as a <nt def="StringTemplate">StringTemplate</nt> by examining
          its first few characters. If the construct turns out not to be a valid <nt def="StringTemplate">StringTemplate</nt>, 
          an error can be reported without first considering whether there is some shorter token that might be returned instead.</p>

        <note><p>The rules here are described much more precisely than in XQuery 3.1, and the results
        in edge cases might be incompatible with some XQuery 3.1 processors.</p></note>
      </item>
      <item><p>Tokenization unambiguously identifies the boundaries of the terminals in the input, and this
        can be achieved without backtracking or lookahead. However, tokenization does
      not unambiguously classify each terminal. For example, it might identify the string <code>"div"</code> as a terminal, but it does not
      resolve whether this is the operator symbol <code>div</code>, or an <code>NCName</code> 
        or <code>QName</code> used as a 
      node test or as a variable or function name. Classification of terminals generally requires information about the
      grammatical context, and in some cases requires lookahead.</p>
      <note><p>Operationally, classification of terminals may be done either in the tokenizer or the parser, or
      in some combination of the two. For example, according to the EBNF, the expression 
        <code>"parent::x"</code> is made up of three
      tokens, <code>"parent"</code>, <code>"::"</code>, and <code>"x"</code>. The name <code>"parent"</code>
        can be classified as an axis name as soon as the following token <code>"::"</code> is recognized, and this
      might be done either in the tokenizer or in the parser. (Note that whitespace and comments are allowed
      both before and after <code>"::"</code>.)</p></note></item>
      <item><p>In the case of a <termref def="dt-complex-terminal"/>, identifying the end of the complex terminal
      typically involves invoking the parser to process any embedded expressions. Tokenization, as described
      here, is therefore a recursive process. But other implementations are possible.</p></item>

              <code>foo- foo</code> results in a syntax error. "foo-" would be recognized as a
              QName.</p>

          <item>
            <p>
              <code role="parse-test">foo -foo</code> is syntactically equivalent to <code
                role="parse-test">foo - foo</code>, two QNames separated by a subtraction
              operator.</p>
          </item>
          <item>

              <code role="parse-test">foo(: This is a comment :)- foo</code> is syntactically
              equivalent to <code>foo - foo</code>. This is because the comment prevents the two
              adjacent terminals from being recognized as one.</p>
          </item>
          <item>
            <p>
              <code role="parse-test">foo-foo</code> is syntactically equivalent to single QName.
              This is because "-" is a valid character in a QName. When used as an operator after
              the characters of a name, the "-" must be separated from the name, e.g. by using
              whitespace or parentheses.</p>

      <p>As the language evolves in the future, it may become necessary to reserve additional

    <p> In the "Associativity" column, "either" indicates that all the operators at that level have
      the associative property (i.e., <code>(A op B) op C</code> is equivalent to <code>A op (B op
        C)</code>), so their associativity is inconsequential. "NA" (not applicable) indicates that
      the EBNF does not allow an expression that directly contains multiple operators from that
      precedence level, so the question of their associativity does not arise. </p>

    <note>
      <p>Parentheses can be used to override the operator precedence in the usual way. Square
        brackets in an expression such as A[B] serve two roles: they act as an operator causing B to
        be evaluated once for each item in the value of A, and they act as parentheses enclosing the
        expression B.</p>
      <p role="xquery">Curly braces in an expression such as validate{E} or ordered{E} perform a
        similar bracketing role to the parentheses in a function call, but with the difference in
        most cases that E is an Expr rather than ExprSingle, meaning that it can use the comma
        operator.</p>
