# X(Q)uery and XSL(T) Specifications (qtspecs)
This is a forked source for the XSLT and XQuery Specifications created for the development of draft 4.0 proposals. This source builds the HTML specs and errata. It is maintained by the W3C XSLT-4.0 Community Group established by Michael Kay.

## Participate in Spec Development
There are numerous paths to participating in qtspec development.

* Join the [XSLT Extensions Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/xslt-40/)--the official W3C Community Group established to develop 4.0 specs. On the group's page you can find mailing list archives and instructions for subscribing to the list. The team is now actively meeting weekly via Zoom. Join the Community Group for more information.
* Open or comment on an [issue](https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues) for the specs. This is the primary method for requesting modifications to the specs. Additions to the spec should be well described in order to aid adoption and implementation. Editorial changes are also accepted via issues.
* Fork the repo, make changes, and make a pull request. Note the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/blob/02722859c851355969a93665c773d2a621b7448f/CONTRIBUTING.md).
* Join the [xml.com Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/xmlcom/shared_invite/zt-1g1yparfo-8JBa2o4zlh_UgxiIwiqwjQ). qtspecs discussion is centered in the #xpath-ng channel.
