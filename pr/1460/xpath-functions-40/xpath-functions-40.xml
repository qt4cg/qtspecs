                XPath 4.0, XQuery 4.0, and XSLT 4.0. 
                The exact syntax used to call these
                functions and operators is specified in <bibref ref="xpath-40"/>, <bibref ref="xquery-40"/> and 
            <bibref ref="xslt-40"/>. </p><p>This document defines three classes of functions:</p><ulist><item><p>General purpose functions, available for direct use in user-written queries, stylesheets, and XPath expressions,
               whose arguments and results are values defined by the <bibref ref="xpath-datamodel-31"/>.</p></item><item><p>Constructor functions, used for creating instances of a datatype from values of (in general) a different
            datatype. These functions are also available for general use; they are named after the datatype that they return,
            and they always take a single argument.</p></item><item><p>Functions that specify the semantics of operators defined in <bibref ref="xpath-40"/> and <bibref ref="xquery-40"/>.
            These exist for specification purposes only, and are not intended for direct calling from user-written code.</p></item></ulist><p>
                <bibref ref="xmlschema-2"/> defines a number of primitive and derived datatypes,
                collectively known as built-in datatypes. This document defines functions and
                operations on these datatypes as well as the other types 
                (for example, nodes and sequences of nodes) defined in <xspecref spec="DM31" ref="types"/> of 
            the <bibref ref="xpath-datamodel-31"/>.
                These functions and operations are available for use in <bibref ref="xpath-40"/>,
                    <bibref ref="xquery-40"/> and any other host language that chooses to reference them.
                In particular, they may be referenced in future versions of XSLT and related XML standards. </p><p><bibref ref="xmlschema11-2"/> adds to the datatypes defined
            in <bibref ref="xmlschema-2"/>. It introduces a new derived type <code nobreak="false">xs:dateTimeStamp</code>, and it
         incorporates as built-in types the two types <code nobreak="false">xs:yearMonthDuration</code> and <code nobreak="false">xs:dayTimeDuration</code>
         which were previously XDM additions to the type system. In addition, XSD 1.1 clarifies and updates many
         aspects of the definitions of the existing datatypes: for example, it extends the value space of
         <code nobreak="false">xs:double</code> to allow both positive and negative zero, and extends the lexical space to allow <code nobreak="false">+INF</code>;
            it modifies the value space of <code nobreak="false">xs:Name</code>
         to permit additional Unicode characters; it allows year zero and disallows leap seconds in <code nobreak="false">xs:dateTime</code>
         values; and it allows any character string to appear as the value of an <code nobreak="false">xs:anyURI</code> item.
         Implementations of this specification <rfc2119>may</rfc2119> support either XSD 1.0 or XSD 1.1 or both.</p><p>In some cases, this specification references XSD for the semantics of operations such as the effect of matching
         using regular expressions, or conversion of atomic items to strings. In most such cases there is no intended
         technical difference between the XSD 1.0 and XSD 1.1 specifications, but the 1.1 version often provides clearer
         explanations and sometimes also corrects technical errors. In such cases this specification
         often chooses to reference the XSD 1.1 specification. This should not be taken as implying that it is necessary
         to invoke an XSD 1.1 processor.</p><p>References to specific sections of some of the above documents are indicated by
                cross-document links in this document. Each such link consists of a pointer to a

               in the <bibref ref="xpath-40"/> language; indeed, in the interests of avoiding duplication, the majority of
               operators (including all higher-order operators such as <code nobreak="false">x/y</code>, <code nobreak="false">x!y</code>, and <code nobreak="false">x[y]</code>,
               as well simple operators such as <code nobreak="false">x,y</code>, <code nobreak="false">x and y</code>, <code nobreak="false">x or y</code>,            
            <code nobreak="false">x&lt;&lt;y</code>, <code nobreak="false">x&gt;&gt;y</code>, <code nobreak="false">x is y</code>, <code nobreak="false">x||y</code>, <code nobreak="false">x|y</code>,
            <code nobreak="false">x union y</code>, <code nobreak="false">x except y</code>, <code nobreak="false">x intersect y</code>, <code nobreak="false">x to y</code>
            and <code nobreak="false">x otherwise y</code>) are now defined entirely within <bibref ref="xpath-40"/>.</p><p>The remaining operators that are described in this publication are those where the semantics of the operator
            depend on the types of the arguments. For these operators, the language specification describes rules for selecting
            an internal function defined in this specification to underpin the operator. For example, when the operator <code nobreak="false">x+y</code>
            is applied to two operands of type <code nobreak="false">xs:double</code>, the function <code nobreak="false">op:numeric-add</code> is selected.</p><p>XPath defines a range of comparison operators <code nobreak="false">x=y</code>, <code nobreak="false">x!=y</code>, <code nobreak="false">x&lt;y</code>, 
               <code nobreak="false">x&gt;y</code>, <code nobreak="false">x&lt;=y</code>, <code nobreak="false">x&gt;=y</code>, <code nobreak="false">x eq y</code>, <code nobreak="false">x ne y</code>, <code nobreak="false">x lt y</code>, 
               <code nobreak="false">x gt y</code>, <code nobreak="false">x le y</code>, <code nobreak="false">x ge y</code>, which apply to a variety of operand types including
            for example numeric values, strings, dates and times, and durations. For each relevant data type, two functions
            are defined in this specification, for example <code nobreak="false">op:date-equal</code> and <code nobreak="false">op:date-less-than</code>.
            These define the semantics of the <code nobreak="false">eq</code> and <code nobreak="false">lt</code> operators applied to operands of that data type. The operators
               <code nobreak="false">x ne y</code>, <code nobreak="false">x gt y</code>, <code nobreak="false">x le y</code>, and <code nobreak="false">x ge y</code> are defined by reference to
               these two; and the <term>general comparison</term> operators <code nobreak="false">=</code>, <code nobreak="false">!=</code>, <code nobreak="false">&lt;</code>, 
               <code nobreak="false">&gt;</code>, <code nobreak="false">&lt;=</code>, and <code nobreak="false">&gt;=</code> are defined by reference to 
               <code nobreak="false">eq</code>, <code nobreak="false">ne</code>, <code nobreak="false">lt</code>, 
               <code nobreak="false">gt</code>, <code nobreak="false">le</code>, and <code nobreak="false">ge</code> respectively.</p><note><p>Previous versions of this specification also defined a third comparison function of the form
            <code role="example" nobreak="false">op:date-greater-than</code>. This has been dropped, as it is always the inverse of the <code nobreak="false">-less-than</code>
            form.</p></note></div2><div2 id="conformance"><head>Conformance</head><changes><change issue="205" PR="326" date="2023-02-01">Higher-order functions are no longer an optional feature.</change></changes><p>

<code nobreak="false">xs:ENTITIES</code> types, and <code nobreak="false">xs:numeric</code> and both the
<code nobreak="false">user-defined list types</code> and
<code nobreak="false">user-defined union types</code>
are special types in that these types are lists or unions
rather than types derived by extension or restriction.</p><div3 id="item-type-hierarchy"><head>Item Types</head><p>The first diagram illustrates
the relationship of various item types.</p><p>Item types are used to characterize the various types of item that can appear
      in a sequence (nodes, atomic items, and functions), and they are therefore used
      in declaring the types of variables or the argument types and result types of functions.</p><p>Item types in the data model form a directed graph, rather than a
hierarchy or lattice: in the relationship defined by the
<code nobreak="false">derived-from(A, B)</code> function, some types are derived from
more than one other type. Examples include functions
(<code nobreak="false">function(xs:string) as xs:int</code> is substitutable for
<code nobreak="false">function(xs:NCName) as xs:int</code> and also for
<code nobreak="false">function(xs:string) as xs:decimal</code>), and union types
(<code nobreak="false">A</code> is substitutable for the union type <code nobreak="false">(A | B)</code> and also
for <code nobreak="false">(A | C)</code>. In XDM, item types include node types,
function types, and built-in atomic types. The diagram, which shows
only hierarchic relationships, is therefore a simplification of the
full model.</p><p role="type-hierarchy-figure">

	                is used. Raising an error is equivalent to calling the <code nobreak="false">fn:error</code>
	                function defined in this section with the provided error code. Except where otherwise
	                specified, errors defined in this specification are dynamic errors. Some errors,
	                however, are classified as type errors. Type errors are typically used where the presence
	         of the error can be inferred from knowledge of the type of the actual arguments to a function, for
	         example with a call such as <code nobreak="false">fn:string(fn:abs#1)</code>. Host languages may allow type errors
	         to be reported statically if they are discovered during static analysis.</p><p> When function specifications indicate that an error is to be raised, the notation 
	            <quote>[<emph>error code</emph>]</quote> is used to specify an error code. Each error defined

	                <code nobreak="false">xs:QName</code> that is actually passed as an argument to the
	                <code nobreak="false">fn:error</code> function. Calling this function raises an error.  For a

This specification uses  <bibref ref="ieee754-2019"/> arithmetic for <code nobreak="false">xs:float</code> and <code nobreak="false">xs:double</code> values.
One consequence of this is that some operations result in the value <code nobreak="false">NaN</code> (not a number), which
has the unusual property that it is not equal to itself. Another consequence is that some operations return the value negative zero.
This differs from <bibref ref="xmlschema-2"/>, which defines
<code nobreak="false">NaN</code> as being equal to itself and defines only a single zero in the value space.
 The text accompanying several functions defines behavior for both positive and negative zero inputs and outputs 
 in the interest of alignment with <bibref ref="ieee754-2019"/>. A conformant implementation must
 respect these semantics. In consequence, the expression <code nobreak="false">-0.0e0</code> (which is actually a unary minus operator 
    applied to an <code nobreak="false">xs:double</code> value) will always return negative zero: see <specref ref="func-numeric-unary-minus"/>. 
    As a concession to implementations that rely on implementations of XSD 1.0, however, when casting from string to double
 the lexical form <code nobreak="false">-0</code> <rfc2119>may</rfc2119> be converted to positive zero, though negative zero
 is <rfc2119>recommended</rfc2119>.
</p><p>XML Schema 1.1 introduces support for positive and negative zero as distinct values, and also uses the <bibref ref="ieee754-2019"/>

               accurate representation of the result.</p></note><p>The <bibref ref="ieee754-2019"/> specification also describes handling of
            two exception conditions called <code nobreak="false">divideByZero</code> and <code nobreak="false">invalidOperation</code>. The 
            IEEE <code nobreak="false">divideByZero</code> exception is raised not only by a direct attempt to divide by zero, but also by
            operations such as <code nobreak="false">log(0)</code>. The IEEE <code nobreak="false">invalidOperation</code> exception is raised by
            attempts to call a function with an argument that is outside the function’s domain (for example,
            <code nobreak="false">sqrt(-1)</code> or <code nobreak="false">log(-1)</code>). 
               Although IEEE defines these as exceptions, it also defines “default non-stop exception handling” in 
                  which the operation returns a defined result, typically positive or negative infinity, or <code nobreak="false">NaN</code>. With this 
                  function library,
               these IEEE exceptions do not cause a dynamic error
            at the application level; rather they result in the relevant function or operator returning
            the defined non-error result. 
               The underlying IEEE exception <rfc2119>may</rfc2119> be notified to the application
            or to the user by some <termref def="implementation-defined">implementation-defined</termref>
               warning condition, but the observable effect on an application 
               using the functions and operators defined in this specification is simply to return
               the defined result (typically <code nobreak="false">-INF</code>, <code nobreak="false">+INF</code>, or <code nobreak="false">NaN</code>) with no error.</p><p>The <bibref ref="ieee754-2019"/> specification distinguishes two <code nobreak="false">NaN</code> values:
               a quiet <code nobreak="false">NaN</code> and a signaling <code nobreak="false">NaN</code>. These two values are not distinguishable in the XDM model:
               the value spaces of <code nobreak="false">xs:float</code> and <code nobreak="false">xs:double</code> each include only a single
               <code nobreak="false">NaN</code> value. This does not prevent the implementation distinguishing them internally,
               and triggering different <termref def="implementation-defined">implementation-defined</termref>
               warning conditions, but such distinctions do not affect the observable behavior of an application

            can be formatted using this format token; indeed, for some numbering sequences there may
            be intrinsic limits. For example, the format token <char>U+2460</char>  has a range imposed by the Unicode character repertoire — <phrase>zero to 20</phrase>
            in Unicode versions prior to <phrase>3.2</phrase>, or <phrase>zero to 50</phrase> in subsequent versions. For the numbering

               <code nobreak="false">i</code> are indicative but not prescriptive. There are various conventions in
            use for how alphabetic sequences continue when the alphabet is exhausted, and differing
            conventions for how roman numerals are written (for example, <code nobreak="false">IV</code> versus
               <code nobreak="false">IIII</code> as the representation of the number 4). Sometimes alphabetic
            sequences are used that omit letters such as <code nobreak="false">i</code> and <code nobreak="false">o</code>. This
            specification does not prescribe the detail of any sequence other than those sequences
            consisting entirely of decimal digits.</p><p>Many numbering sequences are language-sensitive. This applies especially to the sequence
            selected by the tokens <code nobreak="false">w</code>, <code nobreak="false">W</code> and <code nobreak="false">Ww</code>. It also
            applies to other sequences, for example different languages using the Cyrillic alphabet
            use different sequences of characters, each starting with the letter <char>U+0410</char> . In such cases, the <code nobreak="false">$language</code> argument specifies which
            language conventions are to be used. If the argument is specified, the value
               <rfc2119>should</rfc2119> be either an empty sequence or a value that would be valid
            for the <code nobreak="false">xml:lang</code> attribute (see <bibref ref="xml"/>). Note that this
            permits the identification of sublanguages based on country codes (from ISO 3166-1) as
            well as identification of dialects and regions within a country.</p><p>The set of languages for which numbering is supported is <termref def="implementation-defined">implementation-defined</termref>. If the <code nobreak="false">$language</code> argument is absent, or is
            set to an empty sequence, or is invalid, or is not a language supported by the
            implementation, then the number is formatted using the default language from the dynamic
            context. </p><p>The format modifier <rfc2119>must</rfc2119> be a string that matches the regular
            expression <code nobreak="false">^([co](\(.+\))?)?[at]?$</code>. That is, if it is present it must
            consist of one or more of the following, in order:</p><ulist><item><p>either <code nobreak="false">c</code> or <code nobreak="false">o</code>, optionally followed by a sequence of
                  characters enclosed between parentheses, to indicate cardinal or ordinal numbering
                  respectively, the default being cardinal numbering</p></item><item><p>either <code nobreak="false">a</code> or <code nobreak="false">t</code>, to indicate alphabetic or traditional
                  numbering respectively, the default being <termref def="implementation-defined">implementation-defined</termref>.</p></item></ulist><p>If the <code nobreak="false">o</code> modifier is present, this indicates a request to output ordinal
            numbers rather than cardinal numbers. For example, in English, when used with the format
            token <code nobreak="false">1</code>, this outputs the sequence <code nobreak="false">1st 2nd 3rd 4th ...</code>, and
            when used with the format token <code nobreak="false">w</code> outputs the sequence <code nobreak="false">first second
               third fourth ...</code>.</p><p>The string of characters between the parentheses, if present, is used to select between
            other possible variations of cardinal or ordinal numbering sequences. The interpretation
            of this string is <termref def="implementation-defined">implementation-defined</termref>. No error occurs if the implementation does not
            define any interpretation for the defined string.</p><p>It is <termref def="implementation-defined">implementation-defined</termref> what
            combinations of values of the format token, the language, and the cardinal/ordinal
            modifier are supported. If ordinal numbering is not supported for the combination of the
            format token, the language, and the string appearing in parentheses, the request is
            ignored and cardinal numbers are generated instead.</p><p>The use of the <code nobreak="false">a</code> or <code nobreak="false">t</code> modifier disambiguates between numbering
            sequences that use letters. In many languages there are two commonly used numbering
            sequences that use letters. One numbering sequence assigns numeric values to letters in
            alphabetic sequence, and the other assigns numeric values to each letter in some other
            manner traditional in that language. In English, these would correspond to the numbering
            sequences specified by the format tokens <code nobreak="false">a</code> and <code nobreak="false">i</code>. In some
            languages, the first member of each sequence is the same, and so the format token alone
            would be ambiguous. In the absence of the <code nobreak="false">a</code> or <code nobreak="false">t</code> modifier, the
            default is <termref def="implementation-defined">implementation-defined</termref>.</p></def></gitem><gitem><label>Error Conditions</label><def><p>A dynamic error is raised <errorref class="DF" code="1310"/> if the format token is

                        <code nobreak="false">xs:string</code> or a type derived from <code nobreak="false">xs:string</code> are
                        compared (or, equivalently, sorted), the comparisons are inherently
                        performed according to some collation (even if that collation is defined
                        entirely on codepoint values). The <bibref ref="charmod"/> observes that
                        some applications may require different comparison and ordering behaviors
                        than other applications. Similarly, some users having particular linguistic
                        expectations may require different behaviors than other users. Consequently,
                        the collation must be taken into account when comparing strings in any
                        context. Several functions in this and the following section make use of a
                        collation. </p><p>Collations can indicate that two different codepoints are, in fact, equal
                        for comparison purposes (e.g., “v” and “w” are considered equivalent in
                        some Swedish collations). Strings can be compared codepoint-by-codepoint or in a
                        linguistically appropriate manner, as defined by the collation. </p><p>Some collations, especially those based on the 
                  Unicode Collation Algorithm (see <bibref ref="UNICODE-TR10"/>) can be “tailored” for various purposes. This
                        document does not discuss such tailoring, nor does it provide a mechanism to
                        perform tailoring. Instead, it assumes that the collation argument to the
                        various functions below is a tailored and named collation.</p><p>The <termref def="dt-codepoint-collation">Unicode codepoint collation</termref> is a collation
                  available in every implementation, which sorts based on codepoint values. For further details

                        the strength of the collation must be specified as part of the collation
                        URI. For example, suppose there is a collation

                         that refers to a French collation that compares on the basis of
                        base characters. Collations that use the same basic rules, but with higher
                        strengths, for example, base characters and accents, or base characters,
                        accents and case, would need to be given different names, say

                  Note that some specifications use the term collation to refer to
                        an algorithm that can be parameterized, but in this specification, each
                        possible parameterization is considered to be a distinct collation.</p><p>The XQuery/XPath static context includes a provision for a default collation

                  are based on the parameters defined in the Locale Data Markup Language (LDML), defined in <bibref ref="UNICODE-TR35"/>.</p><p>This family of URIs use the scheme and path <code nobreak="false">http://www.w3.org/2013/collation/UCA</code>

                  the rules in the Unicode specifications for the requested tailoring, or fail with a static or dynamic error indicating that it
                  does not provide the collation (the error code should be the same as if the collation URI were not recognized).

            function provides a way of normalizing them according to the rules of a specified
            collation. For example, if the collation ignores accents, then the function will

         arbitrary number of further values can be interpolated. The choice between <code nobreak="false">xs:base64Binary</code>
            and <code nobreak="false">xs:hexBinary</code> is arbitrary; the only operation that behaves differently between the two binary
            data types is conversion to/from a string, and this operation is not one that is normally required for

                    whether it contains another string <code nobreak="false">$arg2</code> as a substring. The result
                    depends on whether <code nobreak="false">$arg2</code> is a substring of <code nobreak="false">$arg1</code>, and
               if so, on the range of <termref def="character">characters</termref> in <code nobreak="false">$arg1</code> which <code nobreak="false">$arg2</code> matches.</p><p>When the <termref def="dt-codepoint-collation">Unicode codepoint collation</termref>
                    is used, this simply involves determining whether <code nobreak="false">$arg1</code> contains a
               contiguous sequence of characters whose <termref def="codepoint">codepoints</termref> are the same, one for one,
                    with the codepoints of the characters in <code nobreak="false">$arg2</code>.</p><p>When a collation is specified, the rules are more complex.</p><p>All collations support the capability of deciding whether two <termref def="string">strings</termref> are
                    considered equal, and if not, which of the strings should be regarded as
                    preceding the other. For functions such as <code nobreak="false">fn:compare</code>, this is
                    all that is required. For other functions, such as <code nobreak="false">fn:contains</code>,
                    the collation needs to support an additional property: it must be able to
                    decompose the string into a sequence of collation units, each unit consisting of
                    one or more characters, such that two strings can be compared by pairwise
                    comparison of these units. (“collation unit” is equivalent to "collation
                    element" as defined in <bibref ref="UNICODE-TR10"/>.) The string
                    <code nobreak="false">$arg1</code> is then considered to contain <code nobreak="false">$arg2</code> as a
                    substring if the sequence of collation units corresponding to <code nobreak="false">$arg2</code>
                    is a subsequence of the sequence of the collation units corresponding to
                    <code nobreak="false">$arg1</code>. The characters in <code nobreak="false">$arg1</code> that match are the
                    characters corresponding to these collation units.</p><p>This rule may occasionally lead to surprises. For example, consider a collation
                    that treats <code nobreak="false">"Jaeger"</code> and <code nobreak="false">"Jäger"</code>
                    as equal. It might do this by treating <code nobreak="false">"ä"</code> as representing
                    two collation units, in which case the
                    expression <code nobreak="false">fn:contains("Jäger", "eg")</code> will return
                    <code nobreak="false">true</code>. Alternatively, a collation might treat "ae" as a single
                    collation unit, in which case the expression <code nobreak="false">fn:contains("Jaeger",
                    "eg")</code> will return <code nobreak="false">false</code>. The results of these functions thus
                    depend strongly on the properties of the collation that is used.</p><p>In addition,
                    collations may specify that some collation units should be ignored during matching. If hyphen is an ignored
					collation unit, then <code nobreak="false">fn:contains("code-point", "codepoint")</code> will be <code nobreak="false">true</code>, 
					and <code nobreak="false">fn:contains("codepoint", "-")</code> will also be <code nobreak="false">true</code>.</p><p> In the definitions below, we refer to the terms <term>match</term> and
                    <term>minimal match</term> as defined in definitions DS2 and DS4 of

                    is not satisfied between two characters that belong to the same collation unit.</p></item></ulist><p>It is possible to define collations that do not have the ability to decompose a
                    string into units suitable for substring matching. An argument to a function
                    defined in this section may be a URI that identifies a collation that is able to
                    compare two strings, but that does not have the capability to split the string
                    into collation units. Such a collation may cause the function to fail, or to
                    give unexpected results, or it may be rejected as an unsuitable argument. The
                    ability to decompose strings into collation units is an <termref def="implementation-defined"/> property of the collation.</p><table class="index"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Function</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="white-space:nowrap; vertical-align:top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><code style="padding-right: 10px" nobreak="false">fn:contains</code></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Returns <code nobreak="false">true</code> if the string <code nobreak="false">$value</code> contains <code nobreak="false">$substring</code> as a

                        languages such as Perl. However, because XML Schema uses regular expressions
                        only for validity checking, it omits some facilities that are widely used
                        with languages such as Perl. This section, therefore, describes extensions
                        to the XML Schema regular expressions syntax that reinstate these capabilities.</p><note><p>
It is recommended that implementers consult <bibref ref="UNICODE-TR18"/> for information on using regular expression processing on Unicode characters.</p></note><p>The regular expression syntax and semantics are identical to those
                            defined in <bibref ref="xmlschema-2"/> with the additions described in the

                  to the syntax or semantics of regular expressions relative to XSD 1.0, but a number
                  of errors and ambiguities have been resolved. For example, the rules for the 
                  interpretation of hyphens within square brackets in a regular expression have been 
                  clarified; and the semantics of regular expressions are no longer tied to a specific 
                  version of Unicode.</p><p>Implementers, even in cases where XSD 1.1 is not supported, are advised to consult
               the XSD 1.1 regular expression specification for guidance on how to handle cases where
               the XSD 1.0 specification is unclear or inconsistent.</p></note><div4 id="matching-start-and-end"><head>Matching the Start and End of the String</head><p> Two meta-characters, <code nobreak="false">^</code> and <code nobreak="false">$</code> are

            the namespace URI <code nobreak="false">http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions</code>. The namespace
            prefix is <termref def="implementation-dependent">implementation-dependent</termref>. The children of this element are a
            sequence of <code nobreak="false">fn:match</code> and <code nobreak="false">fn:non-match</code> elements. This sequence
            is formed by breaking the <code nobreak="false">$value</code> string into a sequence of strings,

            to find the first substring that matches the regular expression. If there are several
            matches, the first match is defined to be the one whose starting position comes first in
            the string. If several alternatives within the regular expression both match at the same
            position in the input string, then the match that is chosen is the first alternative
            that matches. For example, if the input string is <code nobreak="false">The quick brown fox jumps</code>
            and the regular expression is <code nobreak="false">jump|jumps</code>, then the match that is chosen is
               <code nobreak="false">jump</code>.</p><p>Having found the first match, the instruction proceeds to find the second and subsequent
            matches by repeating the search, starting at the first <termref def="character">character</termref> that was not included in the previous match.</p><p>The input string is thus partitioned into a sequence of substrings, some of which match
            the regular expression, others which do not match it. Each substring will contain at
            least one character. This sequence is represented in the result by the sequence of
               <code nobreak="false">fn:match</code> and <code nobreak="false">fn:non-match</code> children of the returned element
            node; the string value of the <code nobreak="false">fn:match</code> or <code nobreak="false">fn:non-match</code> element
            will be the corresponding substring of <code nobreak="false">$input</code>, and the string value of the
            returned element node will therefore be the same as <code nobreak="false">$input</code>.</p><p>The content of an <code nobreak="false">fn:non-match</code> element is always a single text node.</p><p>The content of a <code nobreak="false">fn:match</code> element, however, is in general a sequence of
            text nodes and <code nobreak="false">fn:group</code> element children. An <code nobreak="false">fn:group</code> element
            with a <code nobreak="false">nr</code> attribute having the integer value <var>N</var> identifies the
            substring captured by the <var>Nth</var> parenthesized sub-expression in the regular

               <code nobreak="false">fn:group</code> element in each <code nobreak="false">fn:match</code> element in the

         the <emph>string</emph> on <code nobreak="false">/</code> (solidus) and applying
         <emph>uri decoding</emph> on each token.</p><note><p>The <emph>path</emph> and <emph>path-segments</emph> properties both contain
         the path portion of the URI. The different formats
         only become important when the path contains encoded delimiters.</p><p>Consider <code nobreak="false">/path%2Fsegment</code>. An application may want to decode that,
         using <code nobreak="false">/path/segment</code> in a database query, for example. At the same
         time, an application may wish to modify the URI and then reconstruct it.</p><p>In the string form, decoding <code nobreak="false">%2F</code> to <code nobreak="false">/</code> is
         not reversible. In the <emph>path-segments</emph> form, the path is
         broken into discrete segments where the syntactic delimiters occur.
         This means the encoded delimiters can be decoded without introducing
         ambiguity: <code nobreak="false">("", "path/segment")</code>. In this format, the
         decoding is reversible: escape the non-syntactic delimiters before
         reconstructing the path with the syntactic ones.</p><p>A consequence of constructing the <emph>path-segments</emph> this
         way is that an empty string appears before the first <code nobreak="false">/</code>,
         if the path begins with a
         <code nobreak="false">/</code>, after the last
         <code nobreak="false">/</code>, if the path ends with a
         <code nobreak="false">/</code>, and between consecutive
         <code nobreak="false">/</code> characters. (If the path consists of a single <code nobreak="false">/</code>,
         that <code nobreak="false">/</code> counts as <emph>both</emph> the first and last <code nobreak="false">/</code>,
         producing a segment list containing two empty strings.)</p><p>The
         empty strings may seem unnecessary at first glance, but they assure
         that the path can be reconstructed by joining the segments together
         again without having to handle the presence or absence of a leading or
         trailing <code nobreak="false">/</code> as special cases.</p></note><p>Applying <emph>uri decoding</emph> is equivalent to
         calling <code nobreak="false">fn:decode-from-uri</code> on the string.</p><p>The <emph>query-parameters</emph> value is constructed as follows.
         Start with an empty map. Tokenize the <emph>query</emph> on
         the <code nobreak="false">&amp;</code> (ampersand). For each token, identify
         the <emph>key</emph> and the <emph>value</emph>. If the token
         contains an equal sign (<code nobreak="false">=</code>), the <emph>key</emph>
         is the string that precedes the first equal sign, uri
         decoded, and the <emph>value</emph> is the remainder
         of the token, after the first equal sign, uri decoded. If the
         token does not contain an equal sign, <emph>key</emph> is the
         empty string and the <emph>value</emph> is equal to the
         token, uri decoded. Add the <emph>key</emph>/<emph>value</emph> pair
         to the map. If the <emph>key</emph> already exists in the map, add the <emph>value</emph>
         to a list of values associated with that key. The resulting map, when all
         tokens have been processed, is the <emph>query-parameters</emph> map.</p><p>If the <emph>filepath</emph> is not the empty sequence,
         it is uri decoded. On a Windows system, any
         forward slashes in the path <rfc2119>may</rfc2119> be
         replaced with backslashes.</p><p>A <loc xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#uri-structure-record" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">uri-structure-record</loc> is returned.

         be omitted).</p><p>Implementations may implement additional or different rules for URIs that
         have a scheme or pattern that they recognize. An implementation might choose
         to parse <code nobreak="false">jar:</code> URIs with special rules, for example, since they extend the
         syntax in ways not defined by <bibref ref="rfc3986"/>. Implementations may add

        is made to determine if a password or standard port are present,
        the <code nobreak="false">authority</code> value is simply added to the string.)</p><p>The <code nobreak="false">fn:parse-uri</code> function removes
        percent-escaping when it constructs the
        <code nobreak="false">path-segments</code>, <code nobreak="false">query-parameters</code>, and
        <code nobreak="false">fragment</code> properties. That’s often the most
        convenient behavior but, in order to reconstruct a URI from them,
        special escaping rules apply. These rules protect delimiters
        without encoding additional characters unnecessarily.
        The rules for <code nobreak="false">path-segments</code>,
        <code nobreak="false">query-parameters</code>, and <code nobreak="false">fragment</code> are
        slightly different because the URI encoding conventions are
        slightly different in each case.</p><p>An application with more stringent requirements can
        construct a <code nobreak="false">path</code> or <code nobreak="false">query</code> that
        satisfies the requirements and leave the
        <code nobreak="false">path-segments</code> and/or
        <code nobreak="false">query-parameters</code> keys out of the map.</p><ulist><item><p>If the <code nobreak="false">path-segments</code> key exists in
           the map, then the path is constructed from the segments. To
           construct the path, the possibly encoded segments are
           concatentated together, separated by
           <code nobreak="false">/</code> (solidus) characters.</p><p>The rules for encoding the path segments are different
           for hierarchical and non-hierarchical URIs. If the URI is
           non-hierarchical, no
           encoding is performed on the segments. Otherwise,
           each segment is encoded by replacing any control characters (codepoints less than 0x20)
           and exclusively the following characters with their
           percent-escaped forms: <code nobreak="false"> </code> (space) <code nobreak="false">%</code> (percent
           sign), <code nobreak="false">/</code> (solidus), <code nobreak="false">?</code> (question mark),

           <code nobreak="false">[</code> (left square bracket), and <code nobreak="false">]</code> (right
           square bracket). That is “<code nobreak="false">[#0-#20%/\?\#\+\[\]]</code>”.</p><note><p>Encoding is performed unless the URI is known to be non-hierarchical;
              in other words, encoding is the default. This heuristic improves the
              reliability of using <code nobreak="false">fn:build-uri()</code> on the output of
              <code nobreak="false">fn:parse-uri()</code>. (For example,
              <code nobreak="false">fn:parse-uri('a+b/c') =&gt; fn:build-uri()</code> will return 
              <code nobreak="false">a+b/c</code>.)</p><p>It’s necessary to avoid encoding non-hierarchical schemes because there is more
              variation in them (for example, the <code nobreak="false">tel:</code> scheme
              uses a “<code nobreak="false">+</code>” that must not be encoded). Users working with
              non-hierarchical schemes may need to address the encoding issue directly
              bearing in mind the encoding requirements of the particular schemes in use.</p></note></item><item><p>Otherwise the value of the <code nobreak="false">path</code> key is used.</p></item><item><p>If neither are present, the empty string is used for the path.</p></item></ulist><p>The path is added to the URI.</p><p>If the <code nobreak="false">query-parameters</code> key exists in the map, its value

             calculated by filling 
			in the missing components of the local value from a reference <code nobreak="false">xs:dateTime</code>.  An example of a suitable
         reference <code nobreak="false">xs:dateTime</code> is <code nobreak="false">1972-01-01T00:00:00</code>. Then, for example, the starting
             instant corresponding to the <code nobreak="false">xs:date</code> value <code nobreak="false">2009-03-12</code> is 
             <code nobreak="false">2009-03-12T00:00:00</code>; the starting instant corresponding to the <code nobreak="false">xs:time</code> value
             <code nobreak="false">13:30:02</code> is <code nobreak="false">1972-01-01T13:30:02</code>; and the starting instant corresponding to the
             <code nobreak="false">gMonthDay</code> value <code nobreak="false">--02-29</code> is <code nobreak="false">1972-02-29T00:00:00</code> (which explains
             why a leap year was chosen for the reference).</p><note><p>In the previous version of this specification, the reference date/time chosen was
         <code nobreak="false">1972-12-31T00:00:00</code>. While this gives the same results, it produces a "starting instant" for 
         a <code nobreak="false">gMonth</code> or <code nobreak="false">gMonthDay</code> that bears no
         relation to the ordinary meaning of the term, and it also required special handling of short months. 
         The original choice was made to allow for leap seconds; but since leap seconds are not recognized 
         in date/time arithmetic, this is not actually necessary.</p></note><p>If the <code nobreak="false">xs:time</code> value written as
			<code nobreak="false">24:00:00</code> is to be compared, filling in the missing components gives <code nobreak="false">1972-01-01T00:00:00</code>, 
			because <code nobreak="false">24:00:00</code> is an alternative representation of <code nobreak="false">00:00:00</code> (the lexical value 
			<code nobreak="false">"24:00:00"</code> is
			converted to the time components { 0, 0, 0 } before the missing components are filled
			in). This has the consequence that when ordering <code nobreak="false">xs:time</code> values, 
			<code nobreak="false">24:00:00</code> is
			considered to be earlier than <code nobreak="false">23:59:59</code>. However, when ordering 
			<code nobreak="false">xs:dateTime</code>
			values, a time component of <code nobreak="false">24:00:00</code> is considered equivalent to <code nobreak="false">00:00:00</code> on the
			following day.</p><p>Note that the reference <code nobreak="false">xs:dateTime</code> does not have a timezone.  The <code nobreak="false">timezone</code> component 
			is never filled in from the reference <code nobreak="false">xs:dateTime</code>.  In some cases, if the date/time value does not 
			have a timezone, the implicit timezone from the dynamic context is used as the timezone.</p><note><p>This specification uses the reference <code nobreak="false">xs:dateTime 1972-01-01T00:00:00</code> in the description of the 
			   comparison operators.  Implementations may use other reference <code nobreak="false">xs:dateTime</code> values 
			   as long as they yield the same results.  The reference <code nobreak="false">xs:dateTime</code> used must meet the following 
			   constraints:  when it is used to supply components into <code nobreak="false">xs:gMonthDay</code> values, the year must allow 
			   for February 29 and so must be a leap year; when it is used to supply missing components into <code nobreak="false">xs:gDay</code> 
			   values, the month must allow for 31 days.  Different reference <code nobreak="false">xs:dateTime</code> values may be used for 
			   different operators.</p></note><div3 id="func-dateTime-equal"><head>op:dateTime-equal</head><glist><gitem><label>Summary</label><def><p>Returns <code nobreak="false">true</code> if the two supplied <code nobreak="false">xs:dateTime</code> values refer to the same

A substring enclosed in square brackets is interpreted as a variable marker; substrings
not enclosed in square brackets are taken as literal substrings. 
The literal substrings are optional and if present are rendered unchanged, including any whitespace. 
If an opening or closing square bracket 
is required within a literal substring, it <rfc2119>must</rfc2119> be doubled.
The variable markers are replaced in the result by strings representing 
aspects of the date and/or time to be formatted. These are described in detail below.</p><p>A variable marker consists of a component specifier followed optionally 
by one or two presentation modifiers and/or optionally by a width modifier.
Whitespace within a variable marker is ignored.</p><p>The variable marker may be separated into its components

                  contains a single character, this is interpreted as the first presentation modifier.
                  If it contains more than one character, the last character is examined: if it is valid
                  as a second presentation modifier then it is treated as such, and the preceding part
                  of the substring constitutes the first presentation modifier. Otherwise, the second

There may be ambiguities when dates are recorded using different calendars. 
For example, the start of a new day is not simultaneous in different calendars, 
and may also vary geographically (for example, based on the time of sunrise or sunset).
Translation of dates is therefore more reliable when the time of day is also known, and
when the geographic location is known. 
When translating dates between
one calendar and another, the processor may take account of the values
of the <code nobreak="false">$place</code> and/or <code nobreak="false">$language</code> arguments, with the 
                     <code nobreak="false">$place</code>
argument taking precedence.</p><p>Information about some of these calendars, and algorithms for converting between them, may

It is 
<termref def="implementation-defined">implementation-defined</termref> which
calendars are supported.</p><p>The ISO 8601 calendar (<bibref ref="ISO8601"/>), 
which is included in the above list and designated <code nobreak="false">ISO</code>, 
is very similar to the Gregorian calendar designated <code nobreak="false">AD</code>, but it
differs in several ways. The ISO calendar
    is intended to ensure that date and time formats can be read
    easily by other software, as well as being legible for human
    users. The ISO calendar
prescribes the use of particular numbering conventions as defined in
ISO 8601, rather than allowing these to be localized on a per-language basis. 
In particular it
    provides a numeric “week date” format which identifies dates by
    year, week of the year, and day in the week; 
in the ISO calendar the days of the week are numbered from 1 (Monday) to 7 (Sunday), and
week 1 in any calendar year is the week (from Monday to Sunday) that includes the first Thursday
of that year. The numeric values of the components year, month, day, hour, minute, and second
are the same in the ISO calendar as the values used in the lexical representation of the date and
time as defined in <bibref ref="xmlschema-2"/>. The era (<code nobreak="false">E</code> component)
with this calendar is either a minus sign (for negative years) or a zero-length string (for positive years).
For dates before 1 January, AD 1, year numbers in
    the ISO and AD calendars are off by one from each other: ISO year
    0000 is 1 BC, -0001 is 2 BC, etc.</p><p>ISO 8601 does not define a numbering for weeks within a month. When the <code nobreak="false">w</code>
               component is used, the convention to be adopted is that each Monday-to-Sunday week is considered to
               fall within a particular month if its Thursday occurs in that month; the weeks that fall in a particular
               month under this definition are numbered starting from 1. Thus, for example, 
               29 January 2013 falls in week 5 because the Thursday of the week (31 January 2013) is the fifth Thursday
               in January, and 1 February 2013 is also in week 5 for the same reason.</p><note><p>The value space of the date and time datatypes, as defined in XML Schema, is based on
absolute points in time. The lexical space of these datatypes defines a 
representation of these absolute points in time using the proleptic Gregorian calendar,
that is, the modern Western calendar extrapolated into the past and the future; but the value space
is calendar-neutral. The
<termref def="dt-date-formatting-function">date formatting functions</termref> produce a representation
of this absolute point in time, but denoted in a possibly different calendar. So,
for example, the date whose lexical representation in XML Schema is <code nobreak="false">1502-01-11</code> 
(the day on which Pope Gregory XIII was born) might be
formatted using the Old Style (Julian) calendar as <code nobreak="false">1 January 1502</code>. This reflects the fact
that there was at that time a ten-day difference between the two calendars. It would be
incorrect, and would produce incorrect results, to represent this date in an element or attribute 
of type <code nobreak="false">xs:date</code> as <code nobreak="false">1502-01-01</code>, even though this might reflect the way 
the date was recorded in contemporary documents.</p><p>When referring to years occurring in antiquity, modern historians generally
use a numbering system in which there is no year zero (the year before 1 CE
is thus 1 BCE). This is the convention that <rfc2119>should</rfc2119> be used when the
requested calendar is OS (Julian) or AD (Gregorian). When the requested
calendar is ISO, however, the conventions of ISO 8601 <rfc2119>should</rfc2119> be followed:
here the year before +0001 is numbered zero. In <bibref ref="xmlschema-2"/> (version 1.0), 
the value space for <code nobreak="false">xs:date</code> and <code nobreak="false">xs:dateTime</code>
does not include a year zero: however, XSD 1.1 endorses the ISO 8601 convention. This means that the date on
which Julius Caesar was assassinated has the ISO 8601 lexical representation
-0043-03-13, but will be formatted as 15 March 44 BCE in the Julian calendar
or 13 March 44 BCE in the Gregorian calendar (dependent on the chosen
localization of the names of months and eras).</p></note><p>The intended use of the <code nobreak="false">$place</code> argument is to identify
 the place where an event
represented by the <code nobreak="false">dateTime</code>, <code nobreak="false">date</code>,
or <code nobreak="false">time</code> supplied in the <code nobreak="false">$value</code> argument took place or will take place.
                  If the <code nobreak="false">$place</code> argument is omitted or is set
                  to an empty sequence, then the default place defined in the dynamic context is used.
If the value is supplied, and is not the empty sequence, then it <rfc2119>should</rfc2119> 
                  either be a country code or an IANA timezone name.
               If the value does not take this form, or if its value is not recognized
               by the implementation, then the default place defined in the dynamic context is used.</p><ulist><item><p>Country codes are defined in <bibref ref="ISO3166"/>. Examples are <code nobreak="false">"de"</code> for Germany
      and <code nobreak="false">"jp"</code> for Japan. Implementations <rfc2119>may</rfc2119> also allow the use
of codes representing subdivisions of a country from ISO 3166-2, or codes representing formerly used names of
countries from ISO 3166-3</p></item><item><p>IANA timezone names are defined in the IANA timezone database <bibref ref="olson"/>.

for whom the date or time is being formatted;
that should be done by means of the <code nobreak="false">$language</code> attribute. 
This information 
<rfc2119>may</rfc2119> be used to provide additional information when converting dates between
calendars or when deciding how individual components of the date and time are to be formatted. 
For example, different countries using the Old Style (Julian) calendar started the new year on different
days, and some countries used variants of the calendar that were out of synchronization as a result of
differences in calculating leap years.</p><p>The geographical area identified by a country code is defined by the
  boundaries as they existed at the time of the date to be formatted,
  or the present-day boundaries for dates in the future.</p><p>If the <code nobreak="false">$place</code> argument is supplied in the form
                  of an IANA timezone name that is recognized by the implementation, then the date or
               time being formatted is adjusted to the timezone offset applicable in that timezone.
               For example, if the <code nobreak="false">xs:dateTime</code> value <code nobreak="false">2010-02-15T12:00:00Z</code>
                  is formatted with the <code nobreak="false">$place</code> argument set to
                  <code nobreak="false">America/New_York</code>, then the output will be as if the value
                  <code nobreak="false">2010-02-15T07:00:00-05:00</code> had been supplied. This adjustment takes daylight
                  savings time into account where possible; if the date in question falls during
                  daylight savings time in New York, then it is adjusted to timezone offset <code nobreak="false">-PT4H</code>
                  rather than <code nobreak="false">-PT5H</code>. Adjustment using daylight savings time is only possible
                  where the value includes a date, and where the date is within the range covered
                  by the timezone database.</p></div4></div3><div3 id="date-time-examples"><head>Examples of date and time formatting</head><p>The following examples show a selection of dates and times and the way they might

                    requires the result of the call on <code nobreak="false">fn:index-of</code> to be a singleton integer, 
                    but the static type system cannot infer this; writing the expression as 
                    <code nobreak="false">fn:remove($seq, fn:exactly-one(fn:index-of($seq2, 'abc')))</code> 
                    will provide a suitable static type at query analysis time, and ensures that the length of the sequence is
                    correct with a dynamic check at query execution time.</p><p>The type signatures for these functions deliberately declare the argument type as
                    <code nobreak="false">item()*</code>, permitting a sequence of any length. A more restrictive
                    signature would defeat the purpose of the function, which is to defer
                    cardinality checking until query execution time.</p><div3 id="func-zero-or-one"><head>fn:zero-or-one</head><glist><gitem><label>Summary</label><def><p>Returns <code nobreak="false">input</code> if it contains zero or one items. Otherwise, raises an

            calls on this function return the same document node if the same URI Reference (after
            resolution to an absolute URI Reference) is supplied to both calls. Thus, the following
            expression (if it does not raise an error) will always return <code nobreak="false">true</code>:</p><eg xml:space="preserve">doc("foo.xml") is doc("foo.xml")</eg><note diff="add" at="issue898"><p>This equivalence applies only because the two calls on
            the <code nobreak="false">doc</code> function have the same dynamic context. If two calls on <code nobreak="false">doc</code>
           have different dynamic contexts, then the mapping from URIs to document
         nodes in the two contexts may differ, which means that different document nodes may be returned
         for the same URI.
         This can happen, for example, if the two calls appear in different XSLT packages with different
         validation options or whitespace-stripping options; one call might produce a schema-validated
         document, the other an untyped document.</p></note><p>The requirement to deliver a deterministic result has performance implications, 
            and for this reason implementations may provide a user option to evaluate
            the function without a guarantee of determinism. The manner in which any such option is
            provided is <termref def="implementation-defined"/>. If the user has not selected such an option, a call
            of the function must either return a deterministic result or must raise a dynamic error
               <errorref class="DC" code="0003"/>.</p><note><p>If <code nobreak="false">$source</code> is read from a source document, it is generally appropriate to
               resolve it relative to the base URI property of the relevant node in the source
               document. This can be achieved by calling the <code nobreak="false">fn:resolve-uri</code> function,
               and passing the resulting absolute URI as an argument to the <code nobreak="false">fn:doc</code>
               function.</p></note><p>If two calls to this function supply different absolute URI References as arguments, the
            same document node may be returned if the implementation can determine that the two
            arguments refer to the same resource.</p><p> By defining the semantics of this function in terms of a string-to-document-node
            mapping in the dynamic context, the specification is acknowledging that the results of
            this function are outside the purview of the language specification itself, and depend
            entirely on the run-time environment in which the expression is evaluated. This run-time
            environment includes not only an unpredictable collection of resources (“the web”), but
            configurable machinery for locating resources and turning their contents into document
            nodes within the XPath data model. Both the set of resources that are reachable, and the
            mechanisms by which those resources are parsed and validated, are <termref def="implementation-dependent">implementation-dependent</termref>.</p><p> One possible processing model for this function is as follows. The resource identified
            by the URI Reference is retrieved. If the resource cannot be retrieved, a dynamic error
            is raised <errorref class="DC" code="0002"/>. The data resulting from the retrieval
            action is then parsed as an XML document and a tree is constructed in accordance with
            the <bibref ref="xpath-datamodel-30"/>. If the top-level media type is known and is
            <code nobreak="false">"text"</code>, the content is parsed in the same way as if the media type were text/xml;
            otherwise, it is parsed in the same way as if the media type were application/xml. If
            the contents cannot be parsed successfully, a dynamic error is raised <errorref class="DC" code="0002"/>. Otherwise, the result of the function is the document node
            at the root of the resulting tree. This tree is then optionally validated against a
            schema.</p><p>Various aspects of this processing are <termref def="implementation-defined">implementation-defined</termref>.
            Implementations may provide external configuration options that allow any aspect of the
            processing to be controlled by the user. In particular:</p><ulist><item><p>The set of URI schemes that the implementation recognizes is
                  implementation-defined. Implementations may allow the mapping of URIs to resources

                  URI handlers.</p></item><item><p>The handling of non-XML media types is implementation-defined. Implementations may

                  processing to continue following an error in retrieving a resource, or in parsing
                  and validating its content. When errors have been handled in this way, the
                  function may return either an empty sequence, or a fallback document provided by
                  the error handler.</p></item><item><p>Implementations may provide user options that relax the requirement for the

                     selecting JSON as the output method).
                     The <code nobreak="false">fn:parse-json</code> function will accept any JSON text as input, and converts it

                     such as <code nobreak="false">{ "Sun": 1, "Mon": 2, "Tue": 3, ... }</code> produces a simple map, so if the result

                     using an expression such as <code nobreak="false">$weekdays?Tue</code>. Similarly, a simple array such as
                     <code nobreak="false">[ "Sun", "Mon", "Tue", ... ]</code> produces an array that can be addressed as, for example,
                     <code nobreak="false">$weekdays(3)</code>. A more deeply nested structure can be addressed in a similar way:
                     for example if the JSON text is an array of person objects, each of which has a property named
                     <code nobreak="false">phones</code> which is an array of strings containing phone numbers, then the first phone number of

                     “an element named N” is to be interpreted as meaning “an element node whose local name is N and whose
                     namespace URI is <code nobreak="false">http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions</code>”.</p><olist><item><p>The JSON value <code nobreak="false">null</code> is represented by an element named <code nobreak="false">null</code>, with empty content.</p></item><item><p>The JSON values <code nobreak="false">true</code> and <code nobreak="false">false</code> are represented by an element named <code nobreak="false">boolean</code>,
                        with content conforming to the type <code nobreak="false">xs:boolean</code>. When the element is created by the
                        <code nobreak="false">fn:json-to-xml</code> function, the string value of the element will be <code nobreak="false">true</code> or <code nobreak="false">false</code>.
                        The <code nobreak="false">fn:xml-to-json</code> function also recognizes other strings that validate as <code nobreak="false">xs:boolean</code>,
                        for example <code nobreak="false">1</code> and <code nobreak="false">0</code>. Leading and trailing whitespace is accepted.
                     </p></item><item><p>A JSON number is represented by an element named <code nobreak="false">number</code>,
                        with content conforming to the type <code nobreak="false">xs:double</code>, with the additional restriction that the value
                        must not be positive or negative infinity, nor <code nobreak="false">NaN</code>. The
                        <code nobreak="false">fn:json-to-xml</code> function creates an element whose string value is lexically the same as the JSON representation
                        of the number. The <code nobreak="false">fn:xml-to-json</code> function generates a JSON representation that is the result of casting the
                        (typed or untyped) value of the node to <code nobreak="false">xs:double</code> and then casting the result to <code nobreak="false">xs:string</code>.
                        Leading and trailing whitespace is accepted.
                        Since JSON does not impose limits on the range or precision
                        of numbers, these rules mean that conversion from JSON to XML will always succeed, and will retain full precision
                        in the lexical representation unless the data model implementation is one that reconstructs the string value from
                        the typed value. In the reverse direction, conversion from XML to JSON may fail if the value is infinity or <code nobreak="false">NaN</code>,
                        or if the string value is such that casting to <code nobreak="false">xs:double</code> produces positive or negative infinity.

                        alternative representations: escaped form, and unescaped form.</p></item><item><p>A JSON array is represented by an element named <code nobreak="false">array</code>. The content is a sequence of
                        child elements representing the members of the array in order, each such element being the representation
                        of the array member obtained by applying these rules recursively.</p></item><item><p>A JSON object is represented by an element named <code nobreak="false">map</code>. The content is a sequence
                        of child elements each of which represents one of the name/value pairs in the object. The representation of the
                        name/value pair <var>N:V</var> is obtained by taking the element that represents the value <var>V</var> (by applying these
                        rules recursively) and adding an attribute with name <code nobreak="false">key</code> (in no namespace), whose
                        value is <var>N</var> as an instance of <code nobreak="false">xs:string</code>. The functions <code nobreak="false">fn:json-to-xml</code> and
                        <code nobreak="false">fn:xml-to-json</code> both retain the order of entries, subject to rules about how duplicate keys are handled. The
                        key may be represented in escaped or unescaped form.</p></item></olist><p>The attribute <code nobreak="false">escaped="true"</code> may be specified on a <code nobreak="false">string</code> element to indicate
                     that the string value contains backslash-escaped characters that are to be interpreted according to the JSON
                     rules. The attribute <code nobreak="false">escaped-key="true"</code> may be specified on any element with a <code nobreak="false">key</code> attribute to indicate
                     that the key contains backslash-escaped characters that are to be interpreted according to the JSON
                     rules. Both attributes have the default value <code nobreak="false">false</code>, signifying that the relevant value is in unescaped form.
                     In unescaped form, the backslash character has no special significance (it represents itself).</p><p>The JSON grammar for <code nobreak="false">number</code> is a subset of the lexical space of
                     the XSD type <code nobreak="false">xs:double</code>. The mapping from JSON <code nobreak="false">number</code> values to <code nobreak="false">xs:double</code>
                     values is defined by the XPath rules for casting from <code nobreak="false">xs:string</code> to <code nobreak="false">xs:double</code>. Note that
                     these rules will never generate an error for out-of-range values; instead very large or very small values will be
                     converted to <code nobreak="false">+INF</code> or <code nobreak="false">-INF</code>. Since JSON does not impose limits on the range or precision
                     of numbers, the conversion is not guaranteed to retain full precision.</p><p>Although the order of entries in a JSON object is generally considered to have no significance, the functions
                     <code nobreak="false">json-to-xml</code> and <code nobreak="false">json-to-xml</code> both retain order.</p><p>The XDM representation of a JSON value may either be untyped (all elements annotated as <code nobreak="false">xs:untyped</code>, attributes
                     as <code nobreak="false">xs:untypedAtomic</code>), or it may be typed. If it is typed, then it <rfc2119>must</rfc2119> have the type
                     annotations obtained by validating the untyped representation against the schema given in <specref ref="schema-for-json"/>.
                     If it is untyped, then it <rfc2119>must</rfc2119> be an XDM instance such that validation against this schema would succeed;

            which recognizes the delimiters for rows and fields and returns a sequence
            of arrays each corresponding to one row. The fields within each array are
            represented as instances of <code nobreak="false">xs:string</code>.</p><p>The other two functions recognize column names, and make it easier to address
            individual fields using these names. The <code nobreak="false">parse-csv</code> function
            delivers this capability using XDM maps and functions, while <code nobreak="false">csv-to-xml</code>
            function represents the information using XDM element nodes.</p><div3 id="csv-delimiters"><head>CSV delimiters</head><p>The delimiters used for rows, columns, and quoting are configurable. An error
                  is raised if the same delimiter string is used in multiple roles 
                  <errorref class="CV" code="0003"/>.</p><p>Rows in CSV files are typically delimited with CRLF (<char>U+000D</char>, <char>U+000A</char>), 
                     LF (<char>U+000A</char>), or CR (<char>U+000D</char>) line endings, 
                     although RFC 4180 specifies CRLF. By contrast, the <code nobreak="false">fn:unparsed-text</code>
                     function normalizes these line endings to LF (<char>U+000A</char>).
                     The CSV parsing functions therefore use LF by default. An option is available
                     to normalize line endings so that CR and CRLF are converted to <char>U+000A</char> (except
                     when they appear in quote fields). This option is off by default, because
                     line ending normalization will usually have been carried out earlier: for 
                     example, the <code nobreak="false">fn:unparsed-text</code> function does it automatically.
                  </p><p>The last row in the file may or may not be followed by a row delimiter.</p><p>Fields in CSV are frequently delimited with a comma. Other field
                     delimiters are useful, for
                     example when numeric data uses comma as a decimal separator. The
                     chosen field delimiter is then often <char>U+003B</char>
                     or <char>U+0009</char>.</p><p>The column delimiter defaults to <char>U+002C</char>. 
                     The value may be
                     any single Unicode character. An error is raised if the 
                     <code nobreak="false">column-delimiter</code> option is set to a multi-character string.</p></div3><div3 id="csv-field-quoting"><head>Field quoting</head><p>CSVs, as specified in <bibref ref="rfc4180"/>, require that fields be wrapped with a quote character if they
                  contain either the row or column delimiter. For example:</p><eg xml:space="preserve">"A single field, containing a comma","another field containing CRLF
                  within it"</eg><p>If a field is to contain the quote character, the character must be escaped by doubling it, 
                  as with escaping of quotes in XPath string literals (see <xspecref ref="id-literals" spec="XP40"/>). An error is raised
                  <errorref class="CV" code="0001"/> if a quote character appears within a field

            a mapping from sentences in that grammar to an XML representation. By defining an
            Invisible XML grammar, a great variety of non-XML data formats can be manipulated
            as if they were XML. The function <code nobreak="false">fn:invisible-xml</code> takes a grammar
            as input, and returns a function which can be used for parsing data instances
            and converting them to XML node trees.</p><div3 id="func-invisible-xml"><head>fn:invisible-xml</head><changes><change issue="238 991 1281 1404" PR="791 1256 1282 1405">New in 4.0</change></changes><glist><gitem><label>Summary</label><def><p>Creates an Invisible XML parser for a grammar.</p></def></gitem><gitem><label>Signature</label><def><example role="signature"><proto isOp="no" prefix="fn" name="invisible-xml" return-type="fn(xs:string) as document-node()" returnEmptyOk="no" returnSeq="no" returnVaries="no" isSchema="no" isDatatype="no" isSpecial="no"><arg name="grammar" type="(xs:string | element(ixml))?" default="()"/><arg name="options" type="map(*)?" default="{}"/></proto></example></def></gitem><gitem><label>Properties</label><def><p>This function is <termref def="dt-deterministic">deterministic</termref>, <termref def="dt-context-independent">context-independent</termref>,  and <termref def="dt-focus-independent">focus-independent</termref>. </p></def></gitem><gitem><label>Rules</label><def><p>Conceptually, an <bibref ref="invisible-xml"/> processor
         takes two arguments: a grammar and an input string. The grammar
         is a description of some format and the parser will attempt to
         interpret the input string according to that description. The parser
         returns an XML representation of the input string as parsed
         by the provided grammar. If parsing fails, it returns an XML
         representation that indicates an error occurred and may
         provide additional error information.</p><p>If the function is called twice with the same arguments, it is 
         <termref def="dt-nondeterministic">nondeterministic with respect to node identity</termref>.
         </p><p>For example, the following grammar describes a date as consisting
         of a year, a month, and a day. Each are a sequence of digits and they are
         separated by hyphens:</p><eg xml:space="preserve"> date = year, -'-', month, -'-', day .
 year = d, d, d, d .
month = '0', d | '1', ['0'|'1'|'2'] .
  day = ['0'|'1'|'2'], d | '3', ['0'|'1'] .
   -d = ['0'-'9'] .</eg><p>Using this grammar to parse “2023-10-31” will produce:</p><eg xml:space="preserve">&lt;date&gt;&lt;year&gt;2023&lt;/year&gt;&lt;month&gt;10&lt;/month&gt;&lt;day&gt;31&lt;/day&gt;&lt;/date&gt;</eg><p>Using this grammar to parse “2023-10-32” will produce something like this:</p><eg xml:space="preserve">&lt;fail xmlns:ixml='http://invisiblexml.org/NS' ixml:state='failed'&gt;

&lt;/fail&gt;</eg><p>The exact format of the error output will vary between implementations.
         The only required part of the output is the <code nobreak="false">ixml:state</code> attribute
         that contains the value <code nobreak="false">failed</code>.</p><note><p>Careful readers will observe that the example grammar
         will parse “2023-00-00” as a date. The grammar could easily be extended to
         exclude the “00” forms for month and day, but this is only intended to be
         an illustrative example.</p></note><p>The <code nobreak="false">fn:invisible-xml</code> function takes a grammar and
         returns a function that can be used to parse input strings. In practice,

            to work with alternative versions of a library module. In such cases the author of the

            contain a particular function, and to call a function in that module only if it is
            available in the version that was imported. A static call would cause a static error if
            the function is not available, whereas getting the function using

            function itself. The context thus effectively forms part of the closure of the returned
            function. In practice this applies only where the target of
               <code nobreak="false">fn:function-lookup</code> is a built-in function, because user-defined

(: Explanation:

   The private helper function tc-inclusive takes a set of nodes as input,
   and calls the $step function on each one of those nodes; if the result 
   includes nodes that are not already present in the input, then it makes 
   a recursive call to find nodes reachable from these new nodes, and returns
   the union of the supplied nodes and the nodes returned from the recursive
   call (which will always include the new nodes selected in the first step).
   
   If there are no new nodes, the recursion ends, returning the nodes that 
   have been found up to this point.
   
   The main function fn:transitive-closure finds the nodes that are reachable 
   from the start node in a single step, and then invokes the helper function 
   tc-inclusive to add nodes that are reachable in multiple steps.

This section describes functions that
         operate on maps.</p><p>A map is an additional kind of item.</p><p><termdef id="dt-map" term="map">A <term>map</term> consists of a set of entries, also known
            as key-value pairs. Each entry comprises a key 
            which is an arbitrary atomic item, and an arbitrary sequence called the associated value.</termdef></p><p><termdef id="dt-same-key" term="same key">Within a map, no two entries have the <term>same key</term>. 
            Two atomic items <code nobreak="false">K1</code> and <code nobreak="false">K2</code> are the <term>same key</term>
            for this purpose if the <phrase diff="chg" at="2023-01-25">function call <code nobreak="false">fn:atomic-equal($K1, $K2)</code></phrase>
            returns <code nobreak="false">true</code>.</termdef></p><p>It is not necessary that all the keys in a map should be
            of the same type (for example, they can include a mixture of integers and strings).</p><p>Maps are immutable, and have no identity separate from their content. 
            For example, the <code nobreak="false">map:remove</code> function returns a map that differs
            from the supplied map by the omission (typically) of one entry, but the supplied map is not changed by the operation.
            Two calls on <code nobreak="false">map:remove</code> with the same arguments return maps that are
            indistinguishable from each other; there is no way of asking whether these are “the same map”.</p><p>A map can also be viewed as a function from keys to associated values. To achieve this, a map is also a 
            function item. The function corresponding to the map has the signature 
            <code nobreak="false">function($key as xs:anyAtomicValue) as item()*</code>. Calling the function has the same effect as calling
            the <code nobreak="false">get</code> function: the expression
            <code nobreak="false">$map($key)</code> returns the same result as <code nobreak="false">get($map, $key)</code>. For example, if <code nobreak="false">$books-by-isbn</code>
            is a map whose keys are ISBNs and whose assocated values are <code nobreak="false">book</code> elements, then the expression
            <code nobreak="false">$books-by-isbn("0470192747")</code> returns the <code nobreak="false">book</code> element with the given ISBN.
            The fact that a map is a function item allows it to be passed as an argument to higher-order functions 
            that expect a function item as one of their arguments.</p><div2 id="map-composition-decomposition" diff="add" at="2023-04-19"><head>Composing and Decomposing Maps</head><p>It is often useful to decompose a map into a sequence of entries, or key-value pairs

            two maps by iterating over the keys of the second map, adding each key and its corresponding
            value to the first map as it proceeds. The second call of <code nobreak="false">fn:fold-left</code>
            in the <code nobreak="false">return</code> clause then iterates over the maps supplied in the call
            to <code nobreak="false">map:merge</code>, accumulating a single map that absorbs successive maps
            in the input sequence by calling <code nobreak="false">$combine</code>.</p><p>This algorithm processes the supplied maps in a defined order, but processes the keys within
         each map in implementation-dependent order.</p><p>The use of <code nobreak="false">fn:random-number-generator</code> represents one possible conformant
         implementation for <code nobreak="false">"duplicates": "use-any"</code>, but it is not the only conformant
         implementation and is not intended to be a realistic implementation. The purpose of this
         option is to allow the implementation to use whatever strategy is most efficient; for example,
         if the input maps are processed in parallel, then specifying <code nobreak="false">"duplicates": "use-any"</code>
         means that the implementation does not need to keep track of the original order of the sequence of input
         maps.</p></note><p role="note">If the input is an empty sequence, the result is an empty map.</p><p role="note">If the input is a sequence of length one, the result map is

            types. The type of a map (for example <code nobreak="false">map(xs:integer, xs:string)</code>) is

            operate on arrays.</p><p>An array is an additional kind of item. An array of size <var>N</var> is a mapping from the integers
            (1 to <var>N</var>) to a set of values, called the members of the array, each of which is an arbitrary
            sequence. Because an array is an item, and therefore a sequence, arrays can be nested.</p><p>An array acts as a function from integer positions to associated values, so the
            function call <code nobreak="false">$array($index)</code> can be used to retrieve the array member at a given position.
            The function corresponding to the array has the signature 
            <code nobreak="false">function($index as xs:integer) as item()*</code>. 
            The fact that an array is a function item allows it to be passed as an argument to higher-order functions

            these primitives directly, or invoke other functions that rely on these primitives. The specifications
            avoid relying on XPath language constructs that manipulate arrays, such as array constructor syntax, lookup
            expressions, or FLWOR expressions. This is done to allow these language constructs
            to be specified by reference to this function library, without risk of circularity.</p><p>There is one exception to this rule: for convenience, the notation <code nobreak="false">[]</code> is used to represent
            an empty array, in preference to a call on <code nobreak="false">dm:empty-array()</code>.</p><p>The formal specifications are not intended to provide a realistic way of implementating the
            functions (in particular, any real implementation might be expected to implement <code nobreak="false">array:get</code>
            much more efficiently). They do, however, provide a framework that allows

               For example, the <code nobreak="false">array:reverse</code> function returns an array that differs from the supplied
               array in the order of its members, but the supplied array is not changed by the operation. Two calls
               on <code nobreak="false">array:reverse</code> with the same argument will return arrays that are indistinguishable from

For

                    the <code nobreak="false"> xs:unsignedInt</code> value 12. Another call of that constructor
                    function that returns the same <code nobreak="false">xs:unsignedInt</code> value is
                    <code nobreak="false">xs:unsignedInt("12")</code>. The same result would also be returned if the
                    constructor function were to be called with a node that had a typed value equal
                    to the <code nobreak="false">xs:unsignedInt</code> 12. The standard features described in
                        <xspecref spec="XP31" ref="id-atomization"/> would atomize the node to
                    extract its typed value and then call the constructor with that value. If the
                    value passed to a constructor is not in the lexical space of the datatype to be constructed,

Values cannot belong directly to the type <code nobreak="false">xs:NOTATION</code>, only to its subtypes.
</p></item><item><p>
The lexical representation of these types uses namespace prefixes, whose
meaning is context-dependent.</p></item></ulist><p>
These constraints result in the following rules:</p><olist><item><p>
There is no constructor function for <code nobreak="false">xs:NOTATION</code>. Constructors are defined, however, for <code nobreak="false">xs:QName</code>, 
   for types derived or constructed from <code nobreak="false">xs:QName</code>, and for types 
   derived or constructed from <code nobreak="false">xs:NOTATION</code>.
</p></item><item><p>When converting from an <code nobreak="false">xs:string</code>, the prefix within the lexical 
      <code nobreak="false">xs:QName</code> supplied
      as the argument is resolved to a namespace URI using the statically known
      namespaces from the static context. If the lexical <code nobreak="false">xs:QName</code>
      has no prefix, the
      namespace URI of the resulting expanded-QName is the default namespace for elements and types,
      taken from the static context. Components of the static context are
      defined in <xspecref spec="XP31" ref="static_context"/>. A dynamic error is raised <errorref class="NS" code="0004"/>
      if the prefix is not bound in the static context. As described in
      <xspecref spec="DM31" ref="terminology"/>, the supplied prefix is retained as part of the
      expanded-QName value.</p></item></olist><p>When a constructor function for a namespace-sensitive type is used as a literal function item
      or in a partial function application (for example, <code nobreak="false">xs:QName#1</code> or <code nobreak="false">xs:QName(?)</code>) the namespace
      bindings that are relevant are those from the static context of the literal function item or partial function application.
      When a constructor function for a namespace-sensitive type is obtained by means of the <code nobreak="false">fn:function-lookup</code>
      function, the relevant namespace bindings are those from the static context of the call on <code nobreak="false">fn:function-lookup</code>.</p><note><p>When the supplied argument to the <code nobreak="false">xs:QName</code> constructor
   function is a node, the node is atomized in the usual way, and if the result is <code nobreak="false">xs:untypedAtomic</code> it is then
   converted as if a string had been supplied. The effect might not be what is desired.
   For example, given the attribute <code nobreak="false">xsi:type="my:type"</code>, the expression 
   <code nobreak="false">xs:QName(@xsi:type)</code> might fail on the grounds that the prefix <code nobreak="false">my</code>
   is undeclared. This is because the namespace bindings are taken from the static context
   (that is, from the query or stylesheet), and not from the source document containing the
   <code nobreak="false">@xsi:type</code> attribute. The solution to this problem is to use the function call
   <code nobreak="false">resolve-QName(@xsi:type, .)</code> instead.</p></note></div2><div2 id="constructor-functions-for-xsd-list-types"><head>Constructor functions for XML Schema built-in list types</head><p>Each of the three built-in list

                  When casting from a string to a duration or time or dateTime, it is now specified that when there are more
                  digits in the fractional seconds than the implementation is able to retain, excess digits are truncated.
                  Rounding upwards (which could affect the number of minutes or hours in the value) is not permitted. 
               </change></changes><p>This section applies when the supplied value <var>SV</var>
               is an instance of <code nobreak="false">xs:string</code> or <code nobreak="false">xs:untypedAtomic</code>,
               including types derived from these by restriction. If the value is
               <code nobreak="false">xs:untypedAtomic</code>, it is treated in exactly the same way as a
               string containing the same sequence of characters.</p><p>The supplied string is mapped to a typed value of the target type as defined in <bibref ref="xmlschema-2"/>. 
               Whitespace normalization is applied as indicated by the
               <code nobreak="false">whiteSpace</code> facet for the datatype. The resulting whitespace-normalized string 
               must be a valid lexical form for the datatype.  The semantics of casting follow the rules of
               XML Schema validation.  For example, <code nobreak="false">"13" cast as xs:unsignedInt</code> returns 
               the <code nobreak="false">xs:unsignedInt</code> typed 
               value <code nobreak="false">13</code>. This could also be written <code nobreak="false">xs:unsignedInt("13")</code>.</p><p>The target type can be any simple type other than an
               abstract type. Specifically, it can be a type whose variety is atomic, union, or list.
               In each case the effect of casting to the target type is the same as constructing an element
               with the supplied value as its content, validating the element using the target type as
               the governing type, and atomizing the element to obtain its typed value.</p><p>When the target type is a derived type that is restricted by a pattern facet, the
               lexical form is first checked against the pattern before further casting
               is attempted (See <specref ref="casting-to-derived-types"/>).  If the lexical form does
               not conform to the pattern, a dynamic 
               error <errorref class="RG" code="0001" type="dynamic"/> is raised.</p><p>For example, consider a user-defined type <code nobreak="false">my:boolean</code> which is derived by
               restriction from <code nobreak="false">xs:boolean</code> and specifies the pattern facet <code nobreak="false">value="0|1"</code>.
               The expression <code nobreak="false">"true" cast as my:boolean</code> would fail with a dynamic
               error <errorref class="RG" code="0001" type="dynamic"/>.</p><p>Facets other than <code nobreak="false">pattern</code> are checked <emph>after</emph> the conversion.
               For example if there is a user-defined datatype called <code nobreak="false">my:height</code> 
               defined as a restriction of <code nobreak="false">xs:integer</code> with the facet <code nobreak="false">&lt;maxInclusive value="84"/&gt;</code>,
               then the expression <code nobreak="false">"100" cast as my:height</code> would fail with a dynamic
               error <errorref class="RG" code="0001" type="dynamic"/>.</p><p>Casting to the types <code nobreak="false">xs:NOTATION</code>, <code nobreak="false">xs:anySimpleType</code>, 
               or <code nobreak="false">xs:anyAtomicType</code> is not permitted because these types are abstract (they have
               no immediate instances).</p><p>Special rules apply when casting to namespace-sensitive types. The types <code nobreak="false">xs:QName</code>
               and <code nobreak="false">xs:NOTATION</code> are namespace-sensitive. Any type derived by restriction from 
               a namespace-sensitive type is itself namespace-sensitive, as is any union type having a
               namespace-sensitive type among its members, and any list type having a namespace-sensitive type
               as its item type. For details, see <specref ref="constructor-qname-notation"/>.</p><note><p>Since version 3.0 of this specification, casting has been allowed between <code nobreak="false">xs:QName</code>

                  <code nobreak="false">http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions</code>, namely <code role="example" nobreak="false">fn:put</code>. This function can be used
               to write a document to external storage. It is thus unusual in that it has side-effects; the XQuery Update 1.0
               specification defines semantics for updating expressions including this function.</p><p>Although XQuery Update 1.0 is defined as an extension of XQuery 1.0, a number of implementors have adapted it,
               in a fairly intuitive way, to work with later versions of XQuery. At the time of this publication, later versions of the
               XQuery Update specification remain at Working Draft status.</p></div3></div2><div2 id="functions-defined-by-community-groups"><head>Functions Defined by Community Groups</head><p>A number of community groups, with varying levels of formal organization, have defined specifications for
            additional function libraries to augment the core functions defined in this specification. Many of the resulting
            function specifications have implementations available for popular XPath, XQuery, and XSLT processors, though
            the level of support is highly variable.</p><p>The first such group was EXSLT. This activity was primarily concerned with augmenting the capability of
            XSLT 1.0, and many of its specifications were overtaken by core functions that became available in XPath 2.0.
            EXSLT defined a number of function modules covering:</p><slist><sitem>Dates and Times</sitem><sitem>Dynamic XPath Evaluation</sitem><sitem>Common (containing most notably the widely used <code nobreak="false">node-set</code> function)</sitem><sitem>Math (<code nobreak="false">max</code>, <code nobreak="false">min</code>, <code nobreak="false">abs</code>, and trigonometric functions)</sitem><sitem>Random Number Generation</sitem><sitem>Regular Expressions</sitem><sitem>Sets (operations on sets of nodes including set intersection and difference)</sitem><sitem>String Manipulation (tokenize, replace, join and split, etc.)</sitem></slist><p>Specifications from the EXSLT group can be found at <bibref ref="exslt"/>.</p><p>A renewed attempt to define additional function libraries using XPath 2.0 as its baseline formed
            under the name EXPath. Again, the specifications are in various states of maturity and stability, and
            implementation across popular processors is patchy. At the time of this publication the function libraries that
            exist in stable published form include:</p><slist><sitem>Binary (functions for manipulating binary data)</sitem><sitem>File Handling (reading and writing files)</sitem><sitem>Geospatial (handling of geographic data)</sitem><sitem>HTTP Client (sending HTTP requests)</sitem><sitem>ZIP Facility (reading and creating ZIP files or similar archives)</sitem></slist><p>The EXPath community has also been engaged in other related projects, such as defining packaging
            standards for distribution of XSLT/XQuery components, and tools for unit testing. Its specifications
            can be found at <bibref ref="expath"/>.</p><p>A third activity has operated under the name EXQuery, which as the name suggests has focused
            on extensions to XQuery. EXQuery has published a single specification, RestXQ, which is primarily a 
            system of function annotations allowing XQuery functions to act as endpoints for RESTful services.
            It also includes some simple functions to assist with the creation of such services. The RestXQ specification
            can be found at <bibref ref="exquery"/>.</p></div2><div2 id="functx-library"><head>The FunctX Library</head><p>Many useful functions can be written in XSLT or XQuery, and in this case the function implementations
                  themselves can be portable across different XSLT and XQuery processors. This section describes one such library.</p><p>FunctX is an open-source library of general-purpose functions, supplied in the form of XQuery 1.0 and XSLT 2.0
               implementations. It contains over a hundred functions.

	              and <code role="example" nobreak="false">array:of-members</code> which does the inverse. This has enabled many of the

         below:</p><olist><item><p>In <code nobreak="false">fn:deep-equal</code>, and in other functions such as <code nobreak="false">fn:distinct-values</code>
              that refer to <code nobreak="false">fn:deep-equal</code>, the rules for comparing values of different numeric types 
                 (for example, <code nobreak="false">xs:double</code> and <code nobreak="false">xs:decimal</code>) have changed. 
                 In previous versions of the specification, <code nobreak="false">xs:decimal</code> values were converted
              to <code nobreak="false">xs:double</code>, leading to a possible loss of precision. This could make 
              comparisons non-transitive, leading to problems when grouping,
              and potentially (depending on the sort algorithm) with sorting. The problem has been fixed by requiring
              comparisons to be performed based on the exact mathematical value without any loss of precision.</p><p>This means, for example, that <code nobreak="false">deep-equal(0.2, 0.2e0)</code> is now false, whereas in previous
              versions it was true. The two values are not mathematically equal, because the exact decimal equivalent
              of the <code nobreak="false">xs:double</code> value written as <code nobreak="false">0.2e0</code> is 
                 <code nobreak="false">0.200000000000000011102230246251565404236316680908203125</code>.</p><p>The corresponding change has not been made to the <code nobreak="false">=</code> and <code nobreak="false">eq</code> operators,
              because it was found to be too disruptive. For example, if the context node is the element
              &lt;e price="10.0" discount="0.2"/&gt;, there is an expectation that the expression 
                 <code nobreak="false">@price - @discount = 9.8</code> should return true. But (assuming untyped data), the result of
              the subtraction is an <code nobreak="false">xs:double</code> whose precise value is 
                 <code nobreak="false">9.800000000000000710542735760100185871124267578125</code>, so comparing the two values as
              decimals would return false.</p></item><item diff="add" at="2024-06-18"><p>In previous versions, unrecognized options supplied to the <code nobreak="false">$options</code>
              parameter of functions such as <code nobreak="false">fn:parse-json</code> were silently ignored. In
              4.0, they are rejected as a type error, unless they are QNames with a non-absent namespace,
              or are extensions recognized by the implementation.</p></item><item diff="add" at="2022-12-18"><p>In version 4.0, omitting the <code nobreak="false">$value</code> of <code nobreak="false">fn:error</code> has the same
                 effect as setting it to an empty sequence. In 3.1, the effects could be different (the effect of omitting
                 the argument was implementation-defined).</p></item><item diff="add" at="2023-03-13"><p>In version 3.1, the <code nobreak="false">fn:deep-equal</code> function did not merge adjacent text nodes after stripping
                 comments and processing instructions, so the elements <code nobreak="false">&lt;a&gt;abc&lt;!--note1--&gt;def&lt;/code&gt;</code>
                 and <code nobreak="false">&lt;a&gt;abcde&lt;!--note2--&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;</code> were considered non-equal. In version 4.0, 
                 the text nodes are now merged prior to comparison, so these two elements compare equal.</p></item><item diff="add" at="2023-03-06"><p>In version 4.0, the function signature of <code nobreak="false">fn:namespace-uri-for-prefix</code> constrains the
                 first argument to be either an <code nobreak="false">xs:NCName</code> or a zero-length string (the new coercion rules
                 mean that any string in the form of an <code nobreak="false">xs:NCName</code> is acceptable). If a string is supplied
                 that does not meet these requirements, a type error will be raised. In version 3.1, this was not an error:
                 it came under the rule that when no namespace binding existed for the supplied prefix, the function
                 would return an empty sequence.</p><p>Furthermore, because the expected type of this parameter is no longer <code nobreak="false">xs:string</code>, the
              special coercion rules for <code nobreak="false">xs:string</code> parameters in XPath 1.0 compatibility mode no longer apply.
              For example, supplying <code nobreak="false">xs:duration('PT1H')</code> as the first argument will now raise a
              type error, rather than looking for a namespace binding for the prefix <code nobreak="false">PT1H</code>.</p></item><item diff="add" at="issue687"><p>Version 4.0 makes it clear that the casting of a value other than <code nobreak="false">xs:string</code>
              or <code nobreak="false">xs:untypedAtomic</code> to a list type (whether using a cast expression or a
                 constructor function) is a type error <xerrorref spec="XP" class="TY" code="0004" type="type"/>. 
                 Previously this was defined as an error, but the kind of error and the error code were left unspecified.
              Accordingly, the function signatures of the constructor functions for built-in list types
              have been changed to use an argument type of <code nobreak="false">xs:string?</code>.</p></item><item diff="add" at="issue866"><p>The way that <code nobreak="false">fn:min</code> and <code nobreak="false">fn:max</code> compare numeric values of different types
              has changed. The most noticeable effect is that when these functions are applied to a sequence of
                 <code nobreak="false">xs:integer</code> or <code nobreak="false">xs:decimal</code> values, the result is an <code nobreak="false">xs:integer</code> or 
                 <code nobreak="false">xs:decimal</code>, rather than the result of converting this to an <code nobreak="false">xs:double</code>.</p></item><item diff="add" at="issue780"><p>The type of the third argument of <code nobreak="false">fn:format-number</code> has 
                 changed from <code nobreak="false">xs:string</code> to <code nobreak="false">(xs:string | xs:QName)</code>.
                 Because the expected type of this parameter is no longer <code nobreak="false">xs:string</code>, the
                 special coercion rules for <code nobreak="false">xs:string</code> parameters no longer apply.
                 For example, it is no
              longer possible to supply an instance of <code nobreak="false">xs:anyURI</code> or (when XPath 1.0 compatibility
              mode is in force) an instance of <code nobreak="false">xs:boolean</code> or <code nobreak="false">xs:duration</code>.</p></item></olist><p>For compatibility issues regarding earlier versions, see the 3.1 version of this specification.</p></inform-div1></back></spec>
