        an overview of the changes is provided, along with links to

        table of contents.</change></changes><p>This document defines the XQuery and XPath Data Model 4.0,
which is the data model of <bibref ref="xpath-40"/>, <bibref ref="xslt-40"/>, and
<bibref ref="xquery-40"/>. </p><p>The XQuery and XPath Data Model 4.0 (henceforth “data model”)
serves two purposes.
First, it defines the information contained in the input to an
XSLT or XQuery processor.  Second, it defines all permissible values of
expressions in the XSLT, XQuery, and XPath languages.  A
language is <emph>closed</emph> with respect to a data model if the value
of every expression in the language is guaranteed to be in the data model.
XSLT 4.0, XQuery 4.0, and XPath 4.0 are all closed with respect to
the data model.</p><p>The data model describes items similar to those of
the <bibref ref="xml-infoset"/>
(henceforth “Infoset”).
 It is written to provide a data model suitable for XPath, XQuery and XSLT, which was not a goal of the Infoset,
 and this leads to a number of differences, some of which are:

</p><ulist><item><p>Support for XML Schema types. The XML Schema recommendations
    define features, such as structures (<bibref ref="xmlschema-1"/>)
    and simple data types (<bibref ref="xmlschema-2"/>), that extend
    the Infoset with precise type information.</p></item><item><p>Representation of collections of documents and of
    complex values. </p></item><item><p>Support for typed atomic items.</p></item><item><p>Support for ordered, heterogeneous sequences.</p></item><item><p>Support for additional data types such as maps, arrays, and functions.</p></item></ulist><p>As with the Infoset, the XQuery and XPath Data Model 4.0
specifies what information in the documents is accessible but does
not specify the programming-language interfaces or bindings used to
represent or access the data.</p><p>The data model can represent various
values, including not only the input and the output of a stylesheet or query but all
values of expressions used during the intermediate calculations.
Examples include the input document or document repository (represented
as a document node or a sequence of document nodes), the result of a
path expression (represented as a sequence of nodes), the result of an
arithmetic or a logical expression (represented as an <termref def="dt-atomic-item"/>),
a sequence expression resulting in a sequence of items, etc.
</p><p>This document provides a precise definition of the properties of nodes
in the XQuery and XPath Data Model 4.0, how they are accessed, and how
they relate to values in the Infoset and PSVI.</p></div1><div1 id="terminology-and-notation"><head>Terminology and Notation</head><p>This section introduces terminology and notational conventions that apply
    throughout the document.</p><p>In this document, material labeled as as a <term>note</term> or <term>example</term> 
      is provided for explanatory purposes and are not normative.</p><div2 id="terminology"><head>Terminology</head><p>For a full glossary of terms, see <specref ref="glossary"/>.</p><p>In this specification the phrases <rfc2119>must</rfc2119>, <rfc2119>must

                    text and rendered in small capitals, are to be interpreted as described in
                    <bibref ref="RFC2119"/>.</p><p><termdef id="dt-implementation-defined" term="implementation       defined"><term>Implementation-defined</term> indicates an aspect that
      may differ between implementations, but must be specified by the
      implementer for each particular implementation.</termdef></p><p><termdef id="dt-implementation-dependent" term="implementation       dependent"><term>Implementation-dependent</term> indicates an aspect
      that may differ between implementations, is not specified by this or
      any W3C specification, and is not required to be specified by the
      implementer for any particular implementation.</termdef></p><p>In all cases where this specification leaves the behavior
      implementation-defined or implementation-dependent, the implementation
      has the option of providing mechanisms that allow the user to
      influence the behavior.</p><p>This specification distinguishes between the data model as a general
  concept and specific items (documents, elements, <termref def="dt-atomic-item">atomic items</termref>, etc.)
  that are concrete examples of the data model by identifying all concrete
  examples as <termref def="dt-instance">instances of the data model</termref>.
  </p><p>Sometimes it is necessary to distinguish the case where a
      particular property has no value in the data model. The canonical
      example of such a case is the namespace URI property of an
      <termref def="dt-expanded-qname">expanded QName</termref>
      that is not in any namespace. For such properties, it is
      convenient to be able to speak of “the state of having no value”.
      <termdef id="dt-absent" term="absent">When a property has no value, we
        say that it is <term>absent</term>.</termdef>
    </p><p>Within this specification, the term URI refers to a
      Uniform Resource Identifier as defined in
      <bibref ref="RFC3986"/> and extended in <bibref ref="RFC3987"/>
      with the new name Internationalized Reference Identifier, IRI. The term URI has been retained in preference to
      IRI to avoid introducing new names for concepts such as “Base URI”
      that are defined or referenced across the whole family of XML
      specifications.</p></div2><div2 id="notation"><head>Notation</head><p>To explain the data model, this specification uses both prose and a defined set of accessor
    functions. The accessors are shown with the
    prefix <emph>dm:</emph>. This prefix is always shown in italics to
    emphasize that these functions are abstract; they exist to explain the
    interface between the data model and specifications that rely on the
    data model: they are not accessible directly from the host
    language.</p><p>Several prefixes are used throughout this document for notational
    convenience. The following bindings are assumed.</p><olist><item><p><code nobreak="false">xs:</code> bound to
    <code nobreak="false">http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema</code>
    </p></item><item><p><code nobreak="false">xsi:</code> bound to

    <code nobreak="false">http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions</code>
    </p></item></olist><p>In practice, any prefix that is bound to the appropriate URI may be used.</p><p>The signature of accessor functions is shown using the same style as
    <bibref ref="xpath-functions-40"/>, described in
    <xspecref spec="FO40" ref="func-signatures"/>.</p><p>This document relies on the <bibref ref="xml-infoset"/> and

    and properties are indicated by the styles <emph role="info-item">information
    item</emph> and <emph role="infoset-property">infoset property</emph>, respectively.</p><p>Some aspects of type assignment rely on the ability to access properties of
    the schema components. Such properties are indicated by curly brackets, e.g.,
    {component property}. Note that this does not mean a lightweight schema processor
    cannot be used, it only means that the application must have some mechanism to
    access the necessary properties.</p></div2></div1><div1 id="concepts"><head>Concepts</head><div2 id="basic-concepts"><head>Basic Concepts</head><changes><change issue="225" PR="232" date="2022-11-05">

distinction between an <termref def="dt-item"/> (a node, function, or <termref def="dt-atomic-item"/>) and a
singleton <termref def="dt-sequence"/> containing that item. An item is
equivalent to a singleton sequence containing that item and vice

  <termref def="dt-atomic-item">atomic items</termref>. When a node is added to a sequence its
identity remains the same. Consequently a node may occur in more than
one sequence and a sequence may contain duplicate items.</p><p>Sequences never contain other sequences; if sequences are combined,
the result is always a “flattened” sequence. In other words, appending
“(d e)” to “(a b c)” produces a sequence of length 5: “(a b c d e)”.
It <emph>does not</emph> produce a sequence of length 4: “(a b c (d e))”;
such a nested sequence never occurs.</p><note><p>Sequences replace node-sets from XPath 1.0. In XPath 1.0, node-sets
do not contain duplicates. In generalizing node-sets to sequences,
duplicate removal is provided by functions on node sequences.</p></note><note><p>Arrays and maps are function items and
therefore can also be contained within sequences.</p></note><p>The following constructor and accessor functions are defined for sequences;

<bibref ref="xpath-40"/> and <bibref ref="xquery-40"/>
that have a type system based on <bibref ref="xmlschema-1"/>. To achieve this,
the data model includes (by reference) the Schema Component Model described in
<bibref ref="xmlschema-1"/>.
</p><note><p>The Schema Component Model includes a number of kinds of
component, such as type definitions and element and attribute
declarations, and defines the properties and relationships of these
components. Many of these components and properties are not used by the
language specifications that rely on XDM, and where this is the case,
there is no requirement for implementations to make them visible.
However, this specification makes no attempt to define the minimal
subset of the schema component model that is needed to support the
semantics of XPath and XQuery processing.</p><p>There are two main areas where the language semantics depend on
information in schema components:</p><olist><item><p>Expressions are evaluated with respect to a static context, which
includes schema components, specifically type definitions, element

may be used in language constructs only if the components are present in
the static context.</p></item><item><p>Values including element and attribute nodes, and <termref def="dt-atomic-item">atomic items</termref>,

  a <term>schema</term> is defined as set of schema components. Schema components include,
  for example, element declarations and type definitions.</termdef></p><note><p>This contrasts with a <term>schema document</term>, which is an XML document
  containing an <code nobreak="false">xs:schema</code> element and other XML elements such as 
  <code nobreak="false">xs:element</code> and <code nobreak="false">xs:complexType</code>. In popular usage, the term
    <term>schema</term> is often used inaccurately to refer to a <term>schema document</term>.
  A schema generally consists of the result of processing a set of schema documents linked
  using <code nobreak="false">xs:include</code> and <code nobreak="false">xs:import</code> declarations; it may also
  include built-in schema components that are known intrinsically to a processor, or
  schema components that are constructed programmatically.</p></note><p>It is possible for an application to use more than one schema. For example, a transformation
  may accept as input a source document validated against a schema <var>X</var>, and produce as output a result
  document validated against a different schema <var>Y</var>; the stylesheet or query might import a schema that is the
    union of <var>X</var> and <var>Y</var>. Different modules of a query, or different packages
  within a stylesheet, may import different schemas. When this happens, there is a requirement
  that the different schemas must be <termref def="dt-schema-compatible">compatible</termref> with each other. This requirement is expanded
  in the following paragraphs.</p><p><termdef id="dt-schema-compatible" term="compatible (of schemas)">Two

      means that there must be no schema components in <var>X</var> and <var>Y</var> that have
    the same name but different definitions.</p><p>An implication of this rule is that when one schema document uses <code nobreak="false">xs:redefines</code>
    or <code nobreak="false">xs:override</code> to modify the definitions found in another schema document, the
    resulting schemas will generally be incompatible.</p><p>The rule means that when a type <var>T</var> appears in both <var>X</var> and <var>Y</var>,
  the properties of the schema component corresponding to <var>T</var>, and the properties of all 
    the schema components that it refers to, transitively, will be the same.</p><p>This will always be true (in the absence of <code nobreak="false">xs:redefines</code> and <code nobreak="false">xs:override</code>)
    if both schemas derive their definition of <var>T</var> from the same
    schema document. It may also be true if the definitions of <var>T</var> derive from different

    <termref def="dt-item-type">item types</termref> such as <code nobreak="false">element(*, T)</code>
    and <code nobreak="false">schema-element(E)</code> therefore allow for the possibility that the node being

  implication, that revalidation using the local schema might not succeed.</p><note><p>It is potentially useful to prevent differences arising between different schemas

expression processing (both statically and dynamically) must constitute
a valid schema. This implies, for example, that this total set does not

--><note><p>This makes it the responsibility of the processor to ensure that
the schema components used in the static context of a query or
expression during static analysis are compatible with the schema
components used to validate documents during query or expression
evaluation. This specification does not say how this should be achieved.
</p></note><p>It is also a constraint that the schema information available to the processor must
contain at least the components and properties needed to correctly
implement the semantics of the XPath and XQuery language. For example,
this means that given <phrase diff="chg" at="2022-11-05">an element node</phrase> with a particular type annotation <var>T</var>, and a
  function that expects an argument of type <phrase diff="chg" at="2022-11-05"><code nobreak="false">element(*, S)</code></phrase>, there must be sufficient
information available to the processor to establish whether or not <var>T</var> is

the specifications do not speculate on what happens if they are not.</p></div3><div3 id="types-representation"><head>Representation of Types</head><p>The data model uses

are special types in that these types are lists or unions
rather than types derived by extension or restriction.</p><p>The first diagram illustrates the
relationship of various <termref def="dt-item-type">item
types</termref>. Item types in the data model form a directed graph,
rather than a hierarchy or lattice: in the relationship defined by the
<code nobreak="false">derived-from(A, B)</code> function, some types are derived from
more than one other type. Examples include functions
(<code nobreak="false">function(xs:string) as xs:int</code> is substitutable for
<code nobreak="false">function(xs:NCName) as xs:int</code> and also for
<code nobreak="false">function(xs:string) as xs:decimal</code>), and union types
(<code nobreak="false">A</code> is substitutable for the union type <code nobreak="false">(A | B)</code> and also
for the union type <code nobreak="false">(A | C)</code>). In XDM, item types include node types,
function types, and built-in atomic types. The list, which shows only
hierarchic relationships, is therefore a simplification of the full
model.</p><!-- This markup is slightly idiosyncratic in order to support

<p>The list shows a portion of the type hierarchy, rooted at the abstract type
item. The types <code>xs:anyAtomicType</code>, and the abstract types for nodes
and functions are derived from item. Arrays and maps are further derived from
functions. Attribute, document, element, text, comment, processing-instruction,
and namespace nodes are derived from node. User-defined attribute, document,
and element types are also be derived from attribute, document, and element,
respectively.</p>
--><p>The XPath Data Model is the abstraction over which XPath expressions are evaluated.
    Historically, all of the items in the data model could be derived directly (nodes) or
    indirectly (typed values, sequences) from an XML document. However, as the XPath
    expression language has matured, new features have been added which require additional
    types of items to appear in the data model. These items have no direct XML serialization,
    but they are nevertheless part of the data model.
  </p><p id="hier_anyAtomicType">The next diagram shows all of the
atomic types, including the primitive simple types and the built-in
types derived from the primitive simple types. This includes all the
built-in datatypes defined in <bibref ref="xmlschema-2"/>. Atomic types
act both as <termref def="dt-item-type">item types</termref> (meaning

and as <termref def="dt-schema-type">schema types</termref> (meaning they

special attention. The following sections apply to
<code nobreak="false">xs:QName</code>, <code nobreak="false">xs:NOTATION</code>, and types derived
from them. These types are referred to collectively as “qualified
names”.</p><p>As defined in XML Schema, the lexical space for qualified names
includes a local name and an optional namespace prefix. The value
space for qualified names contains a local name and an optional
namespace URI. Therefore, it is not possible to derive a lexical value
from the typed value, or vice versa, without access to some context
that defines the namespace bindings.</p><p>When qualified names exist as values of nodes in a well-formed document,
it is always possible to determine such a namespace context. However,
the data model also allows qualified names to exist as freestanding
<termref def="dt-atomic-item">atomic items</termref>, or as the name or value of a parentless attribute node,
and in these cases no namespace context is available.</p><p>In this Data Model, therefore, the value space for qualified names
contains a local-name, an optional namespace URI, and an optional
prefix. The prefix is used only when producing a lexical
representation of the value, that is, when casting the value to a
string. The prefix plays no part in other operations involving
qualified names: in particular, two qualified names are equal if their
local names and namespace URIs match, regardless whether they have the
same prefix.</p><p>The following consistency constraints apply:</p><ulist><item><p>If the namespace URI of a qualified name is
<termref def="dt-absent">absent</termref>, then the prefix must
also be
<termref def="dt-absent">absent</termref>.</p></item><item><p>For every element node whose name has a prefix, the prefix must be one
that has a binding to the namespace URI of the element name in the namespaces
property of the element.</p></item><item><p>For every element node whose name has no prefix, the element must have
a binding for the empty prefix to the namespace URI of the element name,
or must have no binding for the empty prefix in
the case where the name of the element has no namespace URI.</p></item><item><p>For every attribute node whose name has a prefix, the attribute node must
either be parentless, or the prefix must be one that has a binding to the

IRI; but both specifications explicitly do not require a processor to
check that namespace names appearing in an instance document are in
fact valid URIs or IRIs.</p><p><termdef id="dt-namespace-uri" term="Namespace URI"> This

Following the lead of <bibref ref="xml-names"/> and <bibref ref="xml-names11"/>,
processors implementing this data model <rfc2119>may</rfc2119> raise an error if a

but they are <emph>not required</emph> to make any checks.
Note that the use of a relative reference as a namespace name is

Namespace names, whatever form they take, are treated as character
strings and compared for equality using codepoint-by-codepoint
comparison, subject only to whitespace normalization if they appear in
a context (for example, within an attribute value) where this is
appropriate.</p><p>In some interfaces, namespace names are held as values of type
<code nobreak="false">xs:anyURI</code>. For example, the namespace part of an expanded QName is
defined to be a value of type <code nobreak="false">xs:anyURI</code>. In
<bibref ref="xmlschema-2"/>, the type <code nobreak="false">xs:anyURI</code> imposes some
restrictions on the value space, but there is latitude for
implementers to decide exactly what these restrictions are. In
<bibref ref="xmlschema11-2"/> there are no restrictions on the form of
an <code nobreak="false">xs:anyURI</code> value, so any sequence of characters is
acceptable within the value space. In this and related specifications,
the use of the type <code nobreak="false">xs:anyURI</code> to hold a namespace name does not imply
any restrictions on the value space beyond those described in this

      representing the Base URI property of a node.</p><note><p>The Base URI property of a document node that derives from parsing an XML document at
      some location typically indicates the location from which the document was retrieved. For a document node
      constructed by a query or stylesheet, it is generally derived from the base URI of the query or
      stylesheet.</p><p>The base URI property of element nodes may vary from that of the containing document node.
      The most common reasons for this are (a) that parts of the document may derive from parsing of
      XML external entities at different locations, and (b) the Base URI property may be explicitly set
      using an <code nobreak="false">xml:base</code> attribute.</p></note><p>The Base URI property of a document or element node may be <termref def="dt-absent"/>, indicating

      by parsing a stream of characters or octets that is not associated with any known location.</p><p> In an ideal world, the value of the Base URI property will conform with the
      <bibref ref="xmlbase"/> Recommendation. It is possible, however, that the algorithm 
      defined in <bibref ref="xmlbase"/> for computing a base URI
    fails to deliver a valid URI. This can arise for various reasons: many software products that construct
    representations of XML documents are liberal in what they accept; some even pre-date the <bibref ref="xmlbase"/>
    Recommendation. The <bibref ref="xml-infoset"/> Recommendation itself acknowledges the concept of

    “synthetic infosets” that do not adhere to all defined constraints. Pragmatically, this specification
    therefore acknowledges the possibility of a third state: the base URI of a document or element node is either
    a valid URI, or it is absent, or it may be invalid. The accessor <code nobreak="false">dm:base-uri</code> when applied to
    a node may therefore deliver either a URI, or the special value <termref def="dt-absent"/>, or it may
    raise an error indicating that the value is invalid. If the Base URI property of a node is invalid,
    then operations that depend on the Base URI (the most obvious example being the <function>fn:base-uri</function>

The process begins with a type, <code nobreak="false">T</code>. If the schema type of the node itself, as
represented in the PSVI, is a complex type with simple content, then <code nobreak="false">T</code> is the
{content type} of the schema type of the node; otherwise, <code nobreak="false">T</code> is the schema type

lexical mapping defined in
<bibref ref="xmlschema-2"/> modified
as appropriate by any applicable rules in
<bibref ref="xmlschema-1"/>. The mapping, so modified, is a function
(in the mathematical sense) which maps to a single value even

</p></item><item><p>Otherwise, the typed value is the result of applying <code nobreak="false">M</code>

sequence of <termref def="dt-atomic-item">atomic items</termref>, 
  each having a well-defined atomic type. This
sequence of atomic items, in turn, determines the
typed-value property of the node in the data model.</p></div5><div5 id="typed-string-relationships"><head>Relationship Between Typed-Value and String-Value</head><p>Element and attribute nodes have both typed-value and string-value
properties (the terms <term>typed value</term> and <term>string value</term> are 
defined at <xspecref spec="XP40" ref="id-typed-value"/> of <bibref ref="xpath-40"/>). 
However, implementations are allowed some flexibility in
how these properties are stored. An implementation may choose to store
the string-value property only and derive the typed-value property from it, or to store
the typed-value property only and derive the string-value property from it, or to store
both the string-value property and the typed-value property.</p><p>To permit these various implementation strategies, some
variations in the string value of a node are defined as insignificant.
Implementations that store only the typed value of a node are permitted to
return a string value that is different from the original lexical form of
the node content. For example, consider the following element:</p><eg xml:space="preserve">&lt;offset xsi:type="xs:integer"&gt;0030&lt;/offset&gt;</eg><p>Assuming that the node is valid, it has a typed value of 30 as an
<code nobreak="false">xs:integer</code>. An implementation may return either “<code nobreak="false">30</code>” or
“<code nobreak="false">0030</code>” as the string value of the node. Any string that is a valid
lexical representation of the typed value is acceptable. In this
specification, we express this rule by saying that the relationship
between the string value of a node and its typed value must be
“consistent with schema validation.”</p><p>If an implementation stores only the string value of a node, the
following considerations apply:</p><ulist><item><p>Where union types occur, the implementation must be able to deliver
the typed value as an instance of the appropriate member type. For
example, if the type of 
an element node is <code nobreak="false">my:integer-or-string</code>, which is
defined as a union of <code nobreak="false">xs:integer</code> and <code nobreak="false">xs:string</code>, and the string value
of the node is “47”, the implementation must be able to deliver the
typed value of the node as either the integer <code nobreak="false">47</code> or the string <code nobreak="false">"47"</code>,
depending on which member type validated the element.</p></item><item><p>Where types of <code nobreak="false">xs:QName</code>, <code nobreak="false">xs:NOTATION</code>, or
types derived from one of these types occur, the implementation must
be able to deliver the typed value as a triple consisting of a local name,
a namespace prefix, and a namespace URI, even though the namespace URI
is not part of the string-value (see
<specref ref="qnames-and-notations"/>).</p></item><item><p>Where an element with a complex type and element-only content
occurs, it is an error to attempt to access the typed-value of the
element node.</p></item></ulist><p>If an implementation stores only the typed value of a node, it must
be prepared to construct string values from not only the node, but in
some cases also the descendants of that node. For example, an element
with a complex type and element-only content has no typed value but
does have a string value that is the concatenation of the
string values of all its text node descendants in document order.</p><p>A further caveat applies if an implementation stores the typed
value of a node. If a new data model is constructed by copying
portions of another data model, and the copy operation does not
preserve inherited namespaces, and the type is a union type that is
sensitive to the namespace context, then the typed value may be
different than what would be obtained by revalidating the node within
its new namespace context. Although this may stretch the semantics of
“consistent with schema validation”, we accept this possibility; it
is not an error.</p></div5><div5 id="pattern-facets"><head>Pattern Facets</head><p>Creating a subtype by restriction generally reduces the
<emph>value</emph> space of the original schema type. For example,
expressing a hat size as a restriction of decimal with a minimum value
of 6.5 and maximum value of 8.0 creates a schema type whose valid values are
only those in the range 6.5 to 8.0.</p><p>The pattern facet is different because it restricts the
<emph>lexical</emph> space of the schema type, not its value space.
Expressing a three-digit number as a restriction of integer with the
pattern facet “[0-9]{3}” creates a schema type whose valid values
are only those with a lexical form consisting of three digits.</p><p>The pattern facet is not reversible in practice. A given point in
the value space might have several lexical representations. In
general, there is no practical way to determine which, if any, of these
representations satisfies the pattern facet of the type.</p><p>As a consequence, pattern facets are not respected when mapping to
an Infoset or during serialization, and values in the data model that
were originally valid with respect to a schema that contains
pattern-based restrictions may be invalid after serialization.</p></div5></div4><!--

not exposed by these functions: in particular, properties related to the

order. Implementations that do not expose the namespace axis can therefore
avoid the overhead of maintaining this information.</p><p>Implementations that expose the namespace axis <rfc2119>must</rfc2119> provide unique

Each element has an associated set of namespace nodes, one for each

nodes.</p><note><p>In implementations that do not expose the namespace axis, there is no
means by which the host language can tell if namespace nodes are shared or not

          extra layer of JNodes in the tree. This is because the structure is designed primarily to
          assist navigation of JTrees derived from JSON processing, in which sequence-valued nodes
          never arise. Generally, JTrees are easier to manipulate if none of the contained arrays
          or maps contain sequence-valued members or entries. JTrees containing non-homogenous
          content (for example, sequences that mix arrays, maps, and other items) can be represented
          using JNodes without loss of information, but may be difficult to navigate.</p></note><p>The following diagram shows the JTree graphically. Each node is connected to
its <code nobreak="false">dm:j-children</code> with arrows. The arrows are numbered to represent the
order of the children.</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" source="xgraph.svg" alt="Graphical depiction of the arbitrary XDM content JTree example." xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="embed" xlink:actuate="onLoad"/>

            and <term>·selector·</term>
          properties will always be absent. For a non-root JNode, these properties will always be present.</p><p>The identity of a root JNode is established when the root JNode is constructed, so that
          every operation that constructs a root JNode returns a JNode with distinct identity. The
          identity of a non-root JNode is a function of its <term>·parent·</term>, <term>·position·</term>, and <term>·selector·</term>
          properties: two non-root JNodes are identical by definition if and only if their
            <term>·parent·</term>s are identical and their <term>·position·</term> and <term>·selector·</term>
            properties are equal as determined by the <function>atomic-equal</function> function.</p><p>A root JNode is constructed, wrapping a map or array, by a call on the <function>jnode</function>
          function applied to that map or array. This can be called explicitly, but it is also called
          implicitly in a number of situations: for example when a map or array is used as the left-hand 
          operand of the path operator <code nobreak="false">/</code>.</p><note><p>An efficient implementation is likely to construct JNodes lazily, as and when a map or
      array is reached by downward navigation using XPath axis steps, which implicitly invoke
      the <code nobreak="false">dm:j-children</code> accessor. Typical implementations of maps and arrays do not
      include parent pointers to a containing map or array; these are contained only transiently
      in the JNode that wraps a map or array reached by downward navigation in the JTree.
      A benefit of not storing parent pointers is that a map or array does not need to be copied
      in order to participate in multiple trees.</p><p>This implementation strategy mirrors the concept of a <term>Zipper</term> data structure
      commonly encountered in other functional programming languages. The general idea is that
      while the core data structure maintains references in one direction only (in this case from
      parent to child), an operation that navigates the data structure can retain additional information
      about the path that was followed, effectively allowing access to nodes of the structure
      that were visited <emph>en route</emph>. This additional information is reified in the
      <term>·parent·</term>, <term>·position·</term>, and <term>·selector·</term> properties
      of a non-root JNode.</p></note></div2></div1><div1 id="conformance"><head>Conformance</head><p>The data model is intended primarily as a component that can be
