   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;564 Ordered Maps&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fix #564&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introduces ordered maps: specifically, sorted maps which return entries in order sorted by key, and fifo maps which return entries in the order of insertion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this has been on the TODO-list for a long time and has many useful applications, raising a PR at this stage is particularly motivated by comments on the elements-to-maps() function pointing out that having a predictable order of properties in serialized JSON can be very useful, and that many existing XML-to-JSON converters achieve this. This gives the opportunity, for example, to parse JSON into a representation that retains input order, delete and/or add some properties, and then serializate the JSON with the order retained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
