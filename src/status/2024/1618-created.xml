   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adaptive serialization: doubles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should make the serialization spec more liberal when it comes to the representation of double values. The prescribed output format is &lt;code&gt;format-number(?, '0.0##########################e0')&lt;/code&gt;, which is very strict and often confusing when maps and arrays are serializes. Maps resulting from JSON convertsions often contain doubles without users noticing it (related: #1583).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should make the behavior implementation-dependent or align it with the serialization of JSON data (without losing its additional features to e.g. serialize function items or sequences). Backward compliance shouldn’t be an important issue, as the method was mainly introduced for debugging purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
