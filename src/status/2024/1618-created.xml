   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adaptive serialization: doubles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should make the serialization spec more liberal when it comes to the representation of double values. The prescribed output format is &lt;code&gt;format-number(?, '0.0##########################e0')&lt;/code&gt;, which is very strict and often confusing when maps and arrays are serialized. Maps resulting from JSON conversions often contain doubles without users noticing it (related: #1583).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should make the behavior implementation-dependent or align it with the serialization of JSON data (without losing its additional features to e.g. serialize function items or sequences). Backward compliance shouldnâ€™t be an important issue, as the method was mainly introduced for debugging purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
