   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Permanent diffs for PRs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since we link to pull requests in the spec and in test cases, I wonder whether it would be possible to publish a permanent diff showing the effect of each PR?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, the idea would be to take the HTML diff as we currently publish it, and reduce it to those sections of the specs that actually contain changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would find this very useful, for example, when a PR has been accepted but is still marked with "Tests needed" - it's not easy at present to see retrospectively what tests might be required. It would also be useful, of course, when implementing the PR. But I think that all readers of the specs might find this beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
