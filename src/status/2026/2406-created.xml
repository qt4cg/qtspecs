   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rounding dates/times and durations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The precision returned for dates, times, and durations is implementation-defined, and it has changed between Saxon releases. This leads one of our users to point out that there is no easy way to request a reduced precision (e.g. milliseconds) in order to ensure interoperability. The simplest approach we can offer seems to be current-dateTime() =&amp;gt; format-dateTime("....") =&amp;gt; xs:dateTime() which is pretty cumbersome and inefficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than providing specific functions for rounding dates, times, and durations, the most versatile solution to this might be to provide functions that reduce a dateTime or duration to a record containing the numeric values of the components, allowing these to be manipulated as numbers, with a further function to reconstruct the dateTime or duration from the record: rather like the parse-uri()/build-uri() pair. Something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;parts(current-dateTime()) ! map:put(., 'seconds', round(?seconds, 3)) ! build-dateTime()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
