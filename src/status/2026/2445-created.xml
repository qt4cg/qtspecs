   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;fn:element-to-map - ignore `xsi:type` and similar attributes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following discussion in #1948, test &lt;code&gt;element-to-map-017&lt;/code&gt; has been changed so it is treated as if the &lt;code&gt;xsi:type&lt;/code&gt; attribute were not present. However, I can't see anything in the current spec to justify this behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I propose changing the spec to say that all attributes in the xsi namespace should be ignored (except to the extent that when the input is schema-validated, they may have affected the choice of a type annotation, which itself may affect the outcome). This means (a) the attribute itself is not included in the result of the conversion, and (b) if all the attributes of an element are in this namespace, the element is treated as having no attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
