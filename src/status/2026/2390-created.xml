   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;methods and inheritance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t panic, i am not suggesting a large change :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But i would like to suggest a small change to the semantics of method calls, with the goal of third parties being able to build something much larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we have,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A method call combines accessing a map M to look up an entry whose value is a function item F, and calling the function item F supplying the map M as the implicit value of the first argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to add,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is no such function, but there is in the map a key fn:fallback whose value is a function, then that function is called with the map, the function name, and the arity of the desired function as arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way one could write a function that looked for an "isa" entry in the map whose value was a sequence of "class" maps, and find the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s limited in that there is no possibility of polymorphic functions, but we do not have those elsewhere in the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One practical benefit is that you can have a map with all your functions in it, and “instance maps’ then do not need to have, say, 40 entries for all the methods that can be called. In an application in which a map gets updated a million times (I do have one of those), adding 40 extra entries to copy is a significant burden, even though of course it’s encapsulated in a single function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
