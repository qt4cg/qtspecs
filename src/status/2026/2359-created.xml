   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implicit conversion to JNodes with absolute path expressions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Section 4.7.1 discusses absolute path expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part of the section concerns leading "/", and includes the note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the context value includes a map or array, it is not converted implicitly to a JNode; rather, a type error occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part concerns leading "//", and includes the statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any map or array that is present in the context value is first coerced to a JNode by applying the [fn:jtree] function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be inferred that "/" doesn't do this conversion, but "//" does. However, this certainly isn't stated explicitly, and there would be no logical reason for treating the two cases differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should either do the conversion for both cases, or for neither.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm inclined to do it for neither. Partly because an implicit conversion wouldn't do any upwards navigation to a different "root" node, as users might expect; partly because doing the conversion reduces the type information available to the compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
