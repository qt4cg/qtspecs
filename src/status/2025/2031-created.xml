   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;2025 JNodes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fix #2025&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a first draft for review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It includes changes to the data model, functions and operators, and XQuery/XPath. It does not yet include changes to XSLT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a big proposal, but I think it removes more complexity from the spec than it adds. It's basically a unification of two concepts, both of which were addressing aspects of the same problem, namely that lookup expressions lose too much information. It gets rid of the pin/label mechanism, and modifiers on lookup expressions, and introduces JNodes and JAxes in their place. (Any suggestions for improved terminology are more than welcome.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we get a lot more "bangs for the buck" with this solution, and it makes navigation of JSON trees work in a much closer way to familiar navigation of XML trees. It needs a lot more work on examples and explanation, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
