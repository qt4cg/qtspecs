   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"x" is not an instance of enum("x")&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The usefulness of enum() types is limited by the fact that the string "x" is not actually an instance of &lt;code&gt;enum("x")&lt;/code&gt;, it is only coercible to that type. This means that in contexts where strict type matching is required (for example, in XSLT patterns), either (a) you can't use enum() the way you would like, or (b) you use it and fail to understand why it fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
