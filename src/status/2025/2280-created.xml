   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usability problems with xsl:array-member&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing tests for the new specification of xsl:array, it's tricky to remember when to use xsl:array-member and when not; and the diagnostics for getting it wrong are obscure (typically, if you use xsl:array-member when it's not needed, you end up with an array of functions, and this leads to subsequent errors saying a function was supplied when something else was expected).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the answer to this may be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(a) the zero-arity function delivered by &lt;code&gt;xsl:array-member&lt;/code&gt; should carry the function annotation &lt;code&gt;%xsl:array-member&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(b) when xsl:array sees a zero-arity function with this annotation in the member sequence, it should invoke the function; any other item (including any other function) is passed through unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect is that any singleton item delivered by the content expression for xsl:array is treated as a single-item member of the constructed array, with the exception of a singleton item constructed using the xsl:array-member instruction, which is treated as a sequence-valued member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
