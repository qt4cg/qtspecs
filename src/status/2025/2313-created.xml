   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;2298 XQFO rules: definition of default values&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;@michaelhkay I have decided to create this PR, even if we are still discussing its necessity. I hope it clarifies where I see the need for unifications in the current presentation. In general, it follows the proposal that I developed in my thoughts in #2298. In particular, it fixes various small inconsistencies in the prose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have stumbled upon related editorial issues that I haven’t worked at yet: &lt;a href="https://qt4cg.org/specifications/xpath-functions-40/Overview.html#id-function-calls"&gt;1.6 Function calls&lt;/a&gt; is outdated, for example the &lt;code&gt;fn:function-name&lt;/code&gt; (which could be confused with the actually existing function with the same name) should have an optional parameter. Next, the text  talks about “two signatures of &lt;code&gt;fn:string&lt;/code&gt;”; and it is not clear why the “zero or one values” and “zero or more values” cases are presented in more detail, whereas “one or more” is missing. The reason is probably simple: It seems to stem back to version 3.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closes #2298&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
