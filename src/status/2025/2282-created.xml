   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;2278 Add function bin:infer-encoding; simplify bin:decode-string&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This PR separates the operation of examining a string to determine its encoding and the presence of a BOM, from the operation of decoding octets. The purpose is to simplify the decode-string function and to reduce complex interactions between its arguments, especially in cases where the BOM might be at the start of a message and the strings to be decoded at some later position. It also has a better chance of retaining compatibility with 1.0 implementations (though it's hard to guarantee that since 1.0 was underspecified).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
