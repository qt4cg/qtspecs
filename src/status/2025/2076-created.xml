   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOC: Interaction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on user feedback that I got, it seems that the solution to expand/collapse a sub-TOC could be more intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;@ndw Would it be possible to remove the rightmost arrow icon, and to simply expand the subentries when a TOC entry is clicked? This would also decrease the number of icons, and it would remove the current, somewhat confusing behavior that a TOC entry is also expanded/collapsed when the empty area to the right of the arrow is clicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could keep the arrow on top level to be able to expand/collapse all entries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
