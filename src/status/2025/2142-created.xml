   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Markup fixes in the HTML output&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moved all the processor comments to the end; this avoids having a comment before &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; which is frowned upon because ... reasons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The XSLT stylesheet was adding links for sections, but so was the main stylesheet, so they were coming out nested.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't attempt to link to functions or elements inside titles. (This also results in nested links)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attempt to "unwrap" &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements around things that can't be inside a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, like various sorts of lists. It's a bit ugly, but it makes for much cleaner HTML.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm just going to merge this because there's no practical way to see the consequences in the PR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apologies in advance that this will introduce some spurious diffs. I think those will go away after the build finishes and after you've rebased your PRs on the new stylesheets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
