   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;2054 Generalized Path Expressions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This proposal (which has the JNodes proposal as its baseline) is a first cut at defining generalised steps and path expressions that handle both XNodes and JNodes in a uniform way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal adds functionality to path expressions (using "/") but does not yet remove the corresponding functionality from lookup expressions (using "?") - that will follow in a subsequent draft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes are largely confined to XPath section ยง4.6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously there is much scope to add notes and examples. There is also a need to reorganise sections so concepts are introduced before they are referenced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
