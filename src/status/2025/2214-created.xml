   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Split XSLT streaming into a separate specification&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one might expect (see #2203), there is pushback against dropping streaming entirely in XSLT 4.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a useful step I think would be to move streaming into a separate specification document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this would be useful for readers; it would put all the information in one place, it would make it much clearer that the feature is an optional addition to the spec, and it would mean that those who aren't interested in it wouldn't be distracted by it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on a project planning level, it would have another big benefit: it would reduce the risk that finishing the work on streaming could jeopardise the whole project. It would become quite feasible to declare XSLT 4.0 complete even though the work on defining streaming is unfinished. This could potentially speed up completion of XSLT 4.0 by a year. Removing this risk is particularly important as there are few people on the project who understand the area really well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
