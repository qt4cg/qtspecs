   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Error handling in and/or expressions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In ยง2.4.5 we introduced the concept of guarded expressions, and included the rules&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In an and expression, the second operand is guarded by the value of the first operand being true.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In an or expression, the second operand is guarded by the value of the first operand being false.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This change is not mentioned in 4.11 Logical Expressions. For example, this still says&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The order in which the operands of a logical expression are evaluated is [implementation-dependent]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the truth tables in 4.11 are unchanged from 3.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(We have also introduced defined terms "and expression" and "or expression", and should use them here).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My understanding of the new rule for guarded expressions is that with (A and B), if A is false then the result is false even if B raises an error; this is not what the truth table says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
