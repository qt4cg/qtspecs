   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make generation of constructor function for named record types optional&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I propose that when a named record type is declared in XQuery or XSLT, the generation of a constructor function should be optional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps in XQuery it should only happen if there is an annotation &lt;code&gt;%constructor&lt;/code&gt;, and in XSLT if there is an attribute &lt;code&gt;constructor="yes"&lt;/code&gt;. I think it's better for the default to be "no constructor" because it's better to make the existence of a constructor explicitly visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are cases where you don't want a system-generated constructor primarily because you want to provide your own constructor which perhaps accepts the data in a slightly different form, or perhaps imposes constraints like cross-validation of supplied arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
