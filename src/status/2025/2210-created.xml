   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;parse-html() - the include-template-content option&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;i propose that we drop this option and instead always behave as currently specified for &lt;code&gt;include-template-content : true()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's an unnecessary burden on implementors to require them to provide two different ways of doing this. And I can't see that always including the content creates any problems for users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current Note suggests that the way an implementation behaves might depend on what architectural approach it is adopting to process the HTML. That in turn suggests that to support both options it might need to adopt a choice of architectural approaches depending on the option chosen: in other words, that the processor needs to implement two completely different approaches to implementing the function. That would indeed be a serious burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there really are implementation difficulties in providing one approach rather than the other, then I think the right answer is to make the choice implementation-defined rather than making it a user option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
