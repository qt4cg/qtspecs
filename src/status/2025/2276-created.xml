   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;XSLT extensibility rules are unnecessarily strict&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rules for vendor extensions in XSLT are unnecessarily strict. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of an extension attribute must not cause the [principal result] or any [secondary result] of the transformation to be different from the results that a conformant XSLT 4.0 processor might produce. They must not cause the processor to fail to raise an error that a conformant processor is required to raise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This greatly reduces the usefulness of vendor extensions (for example, some of Saxon's serialization extensions, such as &lt;code&gt;@saxon:canonical=yes&lt;/code&gt;, are non-conformant) without actually offering any useful increase in interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that in practice implementors have not felt bound by such rules. In practice there is wriggle room anyway: for example if you provide a switch to disable all extensions, then you can say that with that switch set, your processor is a conformant processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should align the extensibility rules across all the specs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
