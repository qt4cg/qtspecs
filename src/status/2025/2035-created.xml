   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recursive record types: unrealistic example in XSLT spec&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The example of mutually-recursive record types in XSLT ยง3.2.8.3.1 (using the schema component model as an example) is unrealistic, because an instance of this structure would be cyclic at the instance level, and therefore would be non-instantiable. In practice, the only way to represent cyclic structures using maps and arrays is by use of functions to represent some of the relationships, as we do in the schema record type returned by functions such as fn:schema-type(). We should change the example to use this technique and explain why it is being used: it would still illustrate the point; although it would be in danger of becoming excessively complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
