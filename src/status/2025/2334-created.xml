   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;XSLT: Parenthesized subexpressions within Patterns&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We seem to have a problem with parenthesized subexpressions / sub patterns within a pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have an extra-grammatical rule:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content of any ParenthesizedPattern within an XNodePattern that contains a / or // operator (other than within a predicate) must itself parse as an XNodePattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This appears to rule out parenthesized sub-expressions that contain both a "/" and a "|" operator, for example &lt;code&gt;a/(b/@x | c/@x)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule is obviously pretty bizarre, and the reason we have it is so that any XNodePattern is a syntactically valid XPath expression, which ensures that we can define the semantics of the pattern in terms of the semantics of XPath expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally we would have different productions for a parenthesised pattern at the top level, and a parenthesised expression within an XNodePattern, but we know that leads to ambiguities (or at any rate, a need for unbounded lookahead). But the current rule isn't an adequate solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
