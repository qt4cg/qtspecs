   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;2214 Separate streaming into its own spec&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is work in progress on splitting off streaming into a separate specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been mainly concerned with (a) a fairly crude extraction of text from the XSLT spec into the new streaming spec (b) fixing up the mechanics of making it build (c) dealing with cross-spec references. The current state is that it builds (for me) but with quite a few cross-referencing errors. Sharing it so that (a) we can see what the dashboard does with it, and (b) to give some visibility of progress, for feedback. There's a lot of detail to be sorted, and of course when we see how the new spec has landed, there will be scope for reorganising the material into a more logical order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fix #2214&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
