   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Absolute path expressions with JTrees&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm thinking there may be a case for disallowing or restricting the use of absolute path expressions over JTrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, there's a strong likelihood that users are only dimly aware of where the root of the tree actually is. They are likely to imagine, if they parse a json text, that the root of the tree will be the root of that text. But in fact the root is wherever they started path navigation from, which may be different. It's likely to be particularly confusing if you move out of JNode space into map/array territory and then back again. Requiring an explicit call on root(), or on ancestor::*[last()], might mean that users think more carefully about it. This makes it clearer that the root is not some kind of absolute fixed point, it is simply "the place where you started your current journey".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly, I don't think we should allow &lt;code&gt;/x&lt;/code&gt; to implicitly construct a JNode wrapping the context item: the '/' here is redundant and means the user almost certainly doesn't understand what they are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another consideration is that if we restrict leading &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; to work only with XTrees, then we reinstate a lot of static type checking capability that we have currently lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
