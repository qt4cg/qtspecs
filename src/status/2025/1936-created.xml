   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;XSD for XSLT 4.0 is missing form="qualified" on several attributes within the attribute group "literal-result-element-attributes"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attributes in attribute group "literal-result-element-attributes" should be in the XSL namespace, and most of them are, except for xsl:default-mode, xsl:default-validation and xsl:expand-text.  Those 3 are missing their form="qualified" attribute, so they would default to being in no namespace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it's non-normative but it would be good to make the correction. (This is also an issue for the XSD for XSLT 3.0).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
