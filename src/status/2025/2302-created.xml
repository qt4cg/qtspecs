   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bad links in EXPath binary spec&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transferred from issue #2195 as it seems to be rather complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EXPath binary spec is being published at location &lt;code&gt;https://qt4cg.org/specifications/expath-binary-40/Overview.html&lt;/code&gt; but internal links generated from &lt;code&gt;function&lt;/code&gt; markup elements are pointing to &lt;code&gt;https://qt4cg.org/specifications/EXPath/binary-40/Overview.html&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incorrect URI is generated because of the variable at xmlspec-2016 line 723; the correct URI is also there, commented out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But simply changing this variable doesn't work (which is presumably why it's commented out). This is because the incorrect URI also appears in other places. It's in the &lt;code&gt;doc.public&lt;/code&gt; entity definition in the heading of the document itself, it's in /etc/BIN40, and it's in database.xml. I haven't managed to work out the process by which these references are generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same factors apply equally to the EXPath file specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
