   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drop XSLT Streaming?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would like to float the idea that we drop streaming from the XSLT 4.0 specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See also #675 and #2128&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason for this is that I don't think we have the resources to do it. I don't think we're likely to find anyone other than me who will step up to the task; and if I attempt it I'm not sure we will find people willing and able to check my work, which is essential because it's devilishly difficult to get the detail right. We have added a lot of new features to the 4.0 spec without applying any thought to their streamability. The introduction of JNodes probably means quite a few rules need to be extended or qualified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the demise of Abel Braaksma's Exselt, Saxon is the only streaming processor available. As far as I can tell, streaming is not widely used: I'm sure we would get a lot more support requests and bug reports if it were, because it's difficult to write streamable code and I know that our implementation is fairly fragile. If the CG were to define all the streamability rules for new 4.0 constructs, I'm not sure we would be able to justify the resources to implement them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In principle we could deprecate the language constructs associated with streaming from the spec and say that the effect of these constructs is implementation-defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is precedent for this with the XQuery Update Facility. This wasn't carried forward to 3.0 partly because of lack of volunteers to do the work, and partly because of differences of opinion about what direction the spec should take. Implementors have found their own ways around the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
