   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;2221 fn:unparsed-text: Encoding, BOM handling&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Closes #2221&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this PR is also a revision of #1950, which I felt was a bit ambiguous, and did not cover all possible cases. I believe that the proposed changes are compatible with 3.1. In particular, it states more clearly what is going to happen if both an implicit encoding is determined (for example, via a BOM), and an explicit encoding is supplied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
