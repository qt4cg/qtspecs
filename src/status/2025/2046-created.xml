   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Promote ".." to a primary expression&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I propose promoting ".." to be a primary expression (rather than an abbreviated step), and (assuming the JNodes proposal is accepted) allowing it to work on JNodes as well as XNodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ignoring JNodes for now, I don't think the change would make any observable difference to the language syntax or semantics. It changes the way that a predicate is interpreted : &lt;code&gt;..[P]&lt;/code&gt; becomes a regular filter expression and is no longer subject to the special rules for predicates within steps; but the only difference is how position() is interpreted, and since &lt;code&gt;..&lt;/code&gt; can only return a singleton, this makes no difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For JNodes it means we will be able to write expressions such as &lt;code&gt;$my-map??x[..?y = 3]&lt;/code&gt; rather than &lt;code&gt;$my-map??x[?parent::*?y = 3]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
