   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;fn:map-to-element&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As this feature request has been reported back to us more than once, I want to raise the question here if we want to introduce a function that inverts the result of &lt;code&gt;fn:map-to-element&lt;/code&gt; back to an XML representation â€“ provided that a conversion plan exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many results would certainly be lossy, but as the plan is now available separately, it would be possible to roundtrip a lot of data with regular structures, without having to write custom conversion code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
