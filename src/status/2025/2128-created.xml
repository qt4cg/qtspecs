   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;JNodes and XSLT Streaming&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In principle, there's no reason why JTrees shouldn't be streamable. However, it's an immense amount of work both for the specification and for an implementation, so I intend to rule it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That then leaves the question about deciding streamability in the case of constructs that could be processing JNodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we might be able to define a rule something like: "if a template rule (etc.) is declared with streamable="yes", this amounts to a declaration that it will only be used to process XNodes, even if without this declaration it would also be capable of processing JNodes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The details depend on other aspects of how we define template rule processing and pattern matching for JNodes. At present I'm inclined to say that the pattern syntax for matching JNodes should be distinct from that for matching XNodes, so that a template can only match one or the other, never both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
