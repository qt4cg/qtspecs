   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;882 Drop fn:chain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fix #882&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supersedes PR #1883&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a great deal of discussion about the relative merits of the status-quo fn:chain function and the proposed replacement fn:compose. The CG was polled on whether it preferred to have fn:chain only, fn:compose only, or both, or neither. There was no clear consensus. The only option which no-one seemed to favour was to have fn:chain only -- which is the status quo. Since no-one is happy with the status quo I am therefore proposing that we drop this function. We can then start with a clean slate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the record the main criticisms of the fn:chain function as currently specified were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(a) it is more useful to have a function that combines several functions into a single function, without actually applying that function to a set of supplied arguments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(b) The function has special-case behaviour for arrays (if the input is not an array and the function has arity &amp;gt; 1 then the input sequence is converted to an array).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(c) The need for the function is not clearly motivated; the examples given can all be achieved in some simpler more intuitive way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
