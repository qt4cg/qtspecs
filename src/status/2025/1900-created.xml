   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Records: instance checks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continues #1862:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last meeting, we discussed whether the order of record entries should be considered in instance checks. After further reflection and attempts to implement it, I believe this will make things much easier in the long term:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://qt4cg.org/specifications/xquery-40/xquery-40.html#id-item-coercion-rules"&gt;3.4.1 Item Coercion Rules&lt;/a&gt;, the coercion of records was added as a second exceptional case: The coercion may change the item in question even if the upstream instance check is succesful. This leads to additional action that I believe could simply be avoided if the successful instance means that no further action is required. I think it will also reduce possible cost that was indicated in https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/1862#issuecomment-2709104860.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: This issue clearly focuses on implications for the implementation. From a user perspective, I assume it will hardly ever make a difference whether we consider order or not. My assumption is that nearly all records will have the expected order anyway, or they will match the order once the first coercion has taken place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this takes time to specify. I will be glad to make an attempt and write the PR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
