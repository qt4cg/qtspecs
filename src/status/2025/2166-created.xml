   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lookup expressions: we have deleted too much text&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In reverting many of the features previously added to lookup expressions (for example deep lookup and lookup modifiers) we seem to have accidentally lost text that actually defines what the different key specifiers mean; we're left with lots of examples but no actual specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reading to see what the current spec says about array bound checking: it appears to say nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
