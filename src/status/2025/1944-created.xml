   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try/Catch/Finally - order of evaluation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm struggling a bit with try/catch/finally. Is there an implied constraint on the order of evaluation? The spec appears to suggest so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;its expression will be evaluated after the expressions of the try clause and a possibly evaluated catch clause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does &lt;strong&gt;evaluated after&lt;/strong&gt; actually mean in a functional language? I can't see how to reconcile this with the general principles of the language regarding lazy evaluation etc. Is there some kind of exception to the general rule that you only have to evaluate as much of an expression as is needed to work out what the result is going to be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that the hidden unstated purpose of "finally" is to execute expressions that have side-effects, and without a proper semantic framework for handling side-effects, this is going to get us into trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
