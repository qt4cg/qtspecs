   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generated appendices in XDM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last four appendices in XDM are stylesheet-generated, and their TOC entries are added "by hand", and as a result they are incorrectly rendered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest using the same process for these appendices as other specs use: they should have a skeletal presence in the XML master, with a processing instruction to direct the stylesheet to expand the content; there is then no need for special machinery in the stylesheet to generate the TOC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
