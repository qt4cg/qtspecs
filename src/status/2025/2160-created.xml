   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;2073 data model changes for JNodes and Sequences&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a first draft of a PR, giving the data model changes only, for a change to the JNode model affecting maps and arrays with sequence-valued entries. A sequence of length 2 or more now has children representing the items in the sequence. Although there is still an asymmetry between sequences of length 1 and longer sequences, it is more manageable than i the previous model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
