   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;1820 Attempt to add change markup in collapsed ToC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fix #1820&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This PR updates the styling so that a small "Δ" is added to the expand arrow when there are changes or additions in the concealed subsections. It's smaller and not blue. I could argue that this is on purpose so that the marking is different and perhaps more subtle. But the truth is, it was just easier to add the Δ without any markup that would make it larger or blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've opted to conceal the Δ when the ToC is "open" on the grounds that you can see what is or isn't marked new on the revealed subsctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
