   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;XSLT: impact of multiple schemas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several places where the impact of allowing multiple schemas in XSLT has not been fully explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.15.1 explains that the in scope schema components for a region of the stylesheet depend on the [xsl:]schema-role attribute governing that region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement in 3.15 that "If the role attribute is absent, the relevant schema components are available in all stylesheet modules within the [declaring package];" is inaccurate; they are only available in regions of the package not governed by an [xsl:]schema-role attribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should also be explained in the part of 5.3.1 (static context) describing in-scope schema components, and in the description of the schema-aware attribute of xsl:evaluate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also note, test coverage of multiple schemas is currently very thin. For example, I think there are no tests for calling constructor functions for atomic types defined in imported schemas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
