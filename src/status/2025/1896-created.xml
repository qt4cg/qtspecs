   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drop "parameter names" as a property of a function item&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the properties of function items is the parameter names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This property is unused; there is nothing that depends on the value of this property, and no way of discovering the value, and it isn't defined for all function items, e.g. maps and arrays, or functions returned by functions such as fn:op. It causes complications, such as whether two functions can have the same identity if they have different parameter names. I propose to drop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are open issues that suggest allowing parameter names to be used in dynamic function calls. But I see little chance of coming up with a design that achieves this, because in general when you're given a function item to call, you have no idea what the parameter names are, and the person supplying the function item has very little control over what the parameter names will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
