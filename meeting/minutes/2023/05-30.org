** Issue #414: Lift character set restriction of xs:string
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: iss-414
:END:

+ See Issue [[https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/414][#414]]. There was a lot of discussion of this issue last
  week. MK has followed-up with [[https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/414#issuecomment-1559849803][a comment]] that proposes a way forword.
  I propose a ten minute time-boxed discussion to answer the question:
  shall we direct someone to write a PR along the lines MK suggests?

MK explains his comment.

+ RD: My understanding with XQuery is that the source text inherits
  this functionality, so technically if a processor implements XML 1.0
  then you can’t have 1.1 characters.
+ MK: We could relax the rules there as well, I’m more concerned with
  things like ~unparsed-text()~, like handling control characters as
  field delimiters in parse-csv.
+ DN: What would be effected? I would like to see how be serializing,
  etc. Which functions would be effected, for example ~codepoints-to-string()~?
+ NW: That will come from the actual proposal…this is just about whether we should
  do it.

Proposal: draft a PR along these lines.

Accepted.

ACTION QT4CG-036-01: NW to draft a PR to resolve issue #414 along the lines MK proposed.

** PR #525: 520: add function identity and use it in deep-equal
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: pr-525
:END:

+ See PR [[https://qt4cg.org/dashboard/#pr-525][#525]]

MK describes the proposal.

+ MK: I was trying to define a universal equality that could apply to
  keys and sets. Hit obstacles, primarily with the existing map
  functions and the fact that they atomize.
  + … Let’s start with the data model…
    + … Adds text describing how functions have identity and how that
      identity is used.
  + … Most of the other changes are in functions and operators…
    + … In the section “properties of functions” we use the identity
      properties for determinism.
    + … In deep-equal, we use function identity
    + … The changes to function-lookup are sort of independent; it had
      got out of date with other things. Tidied that up.
    + … Everything that creates a function now has a clause that
      states how function identity is determined.
  + … And then in XQuery…
    + … Defines identity for partial function application
    + … Describes function identity in 4.4.2.6
      + … Adds exceptions for function identity wrt function references
        and optimization.

Some discussion of what an optimizer may do. Basically, it’s free to
do anything that it can prove won’t change the identity.

+ DN: What is the lifetime/scope of function identity? What about
  permanent functions, the system defined functions? I think we can
  probably assign permanent identities for them. This would
  significantly decrease any kind of house keeping.
+ MK: That’s essentially what this says.
+ DN: Maybe we could be more clear and say that system wide functions
  have permanent identity which is known, and is persisted across
  XPath expressions.
+ MK: There’s no way to compare functions across two different
  execution scopes.
+ DN: That’s why I’m saying this, string-length could always have the
  same identity.
+ MK: But that’s not a testable assertion. That can’t effect the
  result of a query.

DN attempts to describe a scenario where it would matter. For example,
if `transform()` returns a map that contains function items. If the
function item returned, for example, `string-length`, they should be
the same.

+ MK: It’s implementation-defined if the ~transform~ function is
  executed in the same execution scope. So yes, we should clarify
  that.
+ DN: I’m suggesting that system functions should have pre-defined,
  permanent identity that’s well known and will be equal between
  different evaluations. We could have a keyword that defines the
  idnetity of a function.
+ RD: My understanding with this functionality is that an implementor
  gets to decide what the identity is. For example, an implementor
  could use the function pointer as an identity. So the system
  functions for that implementation would have the same identity. That
  would make them the same as a result of evaluating the named
  function reference.
+ MK: Yes. There are many ways you could implement this internally.
  You could use an address in memory a UID or all sorts of ways.
+ MSM: Three points: first, when you were looking at XPath and looking
  at some deletions you said all this stuff moved elsewhere; where did it go?
  + Some discussion of the consequences; the results are the same.
  + … second, you say “it’s helpful to know if two variables refer to
    the same function”, but I always think of other contexts.
  + MK: We have the same problem with nodes; we talk about sequences
    “containing nodes” but what they really contain are “references to nodes”.
    + … It makes it very difficult to talk about identity.
    + MSM: Right, okay.
  + … And I can’t remember what my third point was…
+ JK: Is function identity exposed publicly? Is it up to the
  implementor how they define the identity?
+ MK: The identity is never exposed as a value; all you can do is ask
  if two functions have the same identity. It’s well defined that some
  functions are the same. If you bind one variable to the value of
  another: ~let $x := $y~, you now have a guarantee that
  ~deep-equal($x,$y)~ will return true.
  + … I don’t think we should define how identity is constructed.
+ JL: Is it the case that ~string-length#1~ would be a candidate for
  identity, but not ~string-length#0~.
+ MK: Yes, if it’s dependent on the context, they’re going to be
  different.
  + … The optimizer might be smart enough to work out that a
    collation-dependent function was identical.
+ MSM: I’ve remembered, in the text that we’re looking at (4.4.2.6),
  the beginning of the second paragraph “an expression that returns a
  new function item…” seems to me to be begging the question a little
  with the adjective “new”.
  + MK: That’s why I added the parenthetical remark!

Some further discussion of how this might be worded.

+ MK: Yes, taking the word “new” out might be better.
+ DN: This text speaks only about functions that are not context
  dependent. How do we compare two context-dependent functions?
+ MK: They have different identity.
+ DN: Does this mean that the context is part of the value of the identity?
+ MK: Yes, the saved context (now covered by the data model) is part
  of a function item.
+ DN: It might be useful to put it explicitly here in 4.4.2.6.
+ MK: Okay, yes.
+ RD: I agree with DN that more notes and examples would be good here.
+ JL: I think if we take the case of the standard functions, there
  could be cases where the function item is returned in a different
  context, but it depends on that function if it is context dependent.
  For example, ~count~ is entirely independent of the context.
+ MK: Yes, some depend on parts of the context, some on parts of the
  context that’s invariant across the query.
+ RD: Those are properties of the function.
+ MK: I can elaborate that.
+ DN: How do we compare two indeterministic functions? Is having
  identity enough?
+ MK: That’s a good question. If you compare the random number
  generator function with itself, it’s not deterministic but it is
  identical to itself.
  + … Function identity is related to determinism, but it’s not
    exactly the same thing.
  + … The fact that a function isn’t deterministic doesn’t mean it
    isn’t identical to itself.
+ JL: That would cover ~map:keys~ as well?
+ MK: Yes, that’s part of the discussion fo determinism.
+ MK: They key thing is whether or not the functions are
  distinguishable.

ACTION QT4CG-036-02: MK to revise function identity following the discussion in meeting 036.

Proposal: Accept this PR?

Accepted.

** PR #524: 503: reinstate focus functions
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: pr-524
:END:

+ See PR [[https://qt4cg.org/dashboard/#pr-524][#524]]

MK describes the proposal.

+ MK: This is a feature we had, but it went sideways when we changed
  the syntax for lambda functions.
+ … The proposal is basically to implement CG’s suggestion of using ~function {}~
+ … It’s semantically different so described in its own section, §4.4.2.5
+ DN: I would suggest that before we commit to this, everyone reads
  the whole thread of the issue. I’ll summarize: we are not doing a
  service to the XPath user. Generally, I think this makes things
  messy and not maintainable. We should have all this in mind.

Proposal: Accept this PR?

+ DN: I object.
+ NW: Are you prepared to accept that consensus is against you?
+ DN: Yes. But I still think it’s a mistake.

The proposal is accepted.

** PR #521: 518: Add transitive-closure() function
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: pr-521
:END:

+ See PR [[https://qt4cg.org/dashboard/#pr-521][#521]]

+ MK: I’ve mangled the diffs.

Some grumbling about PRs and diffs and merge conflicts.

+ MK: I did have one technical question; should transitive closure
  include the starting item or not?
  + It’s easier to write the function if it does, but easier to use if
    you don’t. So it’s 1 or more steps instead of zero or more steps.
  + The CS literature seems to favor 1 or more steps.
+ MK: I decided to define it only over nodes for the time being
  because we only have sets of nodes. If we have sets of other things,
  it could be generalized easily enough.
  + … I made it start with a set of nodes instead of a single node.
+ MK: If your function creates new nodes, you could be in a non-terminating position.
+ MSM: I think that the question that you asked about whether to
  include the initial item is the difference between reflexive
  transitive closure and positive transitive closure. Given a binary
  relation R, these will be written as R* or R+.
  + … I’m struggling in part because I think of taking the transitive
    closure as starting from a relation and returning a relation.
+ MK: I did consider making this a function that operates over
  functions, but in a sense what we’ve delivered here is a composite
  of getting a new function and applying it. I thought that would be
  more useful.
+ MSM: Blind faith in generality leads me to think this might be
  better has a higher-order-function with some syntactic sugar for applying it.
+ MK: That’s a very good point.
+ DN: First, did I understand that MK defined transitive closure as
  something that excludes the starting step? Because we have good
  examples of transitive closure in XPath that includes the first
  step: ancstor-or-self, for example.
+ MK: Yes.
+ DN: So we could have a flag to determine if that should be included
  or not.
+ DN: Second, a question about non-termination. Then from a
  programmability point of view, it’s possible to have something
  equivalent to “time out”, perhaps a maximium limit in the number of
  items in the interation to raise an error or call some other
  functions. In other cases, we wouldn’t know what it’s runtime
  behavior would be.
+ JL: With this example, it might be worth putting a note in that the
  evaluation of the function body itself has a context of the
  evaluation of the transitive closure. That needs to be fairly
  carefully described.
+ MK: The subtlety is the function that uses ~//~ to go back to the root.
+ JL: Yes, but the @id isn’t part of that.
+ MK: Yes, that is subtle.
+ MSM: Following up on DN’s suggestion that we allow a parameter to
  bound the computation, I think the natural parameter here is the
  number of steps.
+ NW: That’s what I would have thought
+ RD: 👍
+ MK: That’s a feature rather than just a way of stopping termination.
+ MSM: If we wanted to go futher, we could allow a range. Give me this
  relation applied exactly three times or two-to-four times and the
  default would be (0,1)-*.
+ MK: Are we over-engineering?
+ MSM: Maybe, but the 0 or 1 is precisely the difference between the two kinds.
+ RD: Perhaps adding an ancestor example would help.
