DN and LQ (Liam Quin) have indicated that this PR is now ready for discussion.
It’s on the agenda this week only as a heads-up. I propose that we discuss it
next week. DN and LQ will join the call.

MK introduces the PR.

+ MK: The motivation was to get rid of exception cases and to better align
  comparison and equality.
  + … In the status quo, you can’t use ~compare()~ to compare things that might
    be unordered (like QNames)
  + … Sometimes the ordering is arbitrary (~true()~ and ~false()~), but they are ordered.
  + … The ordering for durations is perhaps most problematic; it remains as it
    was, but it’s not an error to attempt to sort them.
  + … The data model impact is quite small, it just says they’re all ordered
  + … We introduce families of atomic types
  + … The XPath impact is largely the value comparison operators.
  + … The main change is that we remove a great table of comparison functions.
  + … Value comparisons are defined in terms of ~fn:compare()~.
    + … There’s a special case for ~NaN~.
  + … We’ve lost a lot of examples with the table; I tried to make sure we have a reasonable set.
    + … We could add more.

ACTION QT4CG-144-01: MK to consider if any now lost value comparisons should be added as examples.

+ MK: F&O now begins with an apology that it no longer defines any operators!
+ MK: I’ve introduced the term ~contextually equal~ if ~fn:compare()~ returns zero (with the appropriate dynamic context)
  + … ~fn:atomic-equal()~ is now defined in terms of compare for numerics.
  + … Editorial changes to ~fn:compare()~.
  + … ~fn:deep-equal()~ now refers to ~fn:compare()~ returning zero.
  + … ~fn:distinct-value()~ refers to ~contextually equal~.
  + … ~fn:index-of~ now uses the same ~contextually equal~ comparison; that is a technical change.
    + … It compares ~NaN~ as equal to ~NaN~.
  + … Lots of textual change to ~fn:min()~ and ~fn:max()~, but not significant
  + … ~fn:highest()~ and ~fn:lowest()~ get some editorial changes
  + … In ~fn:substring()~, the arithmetic no longer refers to numeric-less-than operator.
  + … Arithmetic is still only defined on the duration subtypes.
  + … All the other changes are about removing the operators.

+ NW: Why did we do it the way we did in 2.0?
+ MK: I don’t know. Someone thought it was a good idea. But now that we’ve introduced the general
  ~fn:compare~ function so that’s just a lot of duplication.
+ JWL: Are there any serious backwards incompatibilities?
+ MK: The only one I’m aware of is ~NaN~ in ~fn:index-of()~.

Proposal: accept this PR.

Accepted.

(MK believes that CG agreed in principle.)

** PR #2301: 2198 Add cdata attribute to xsl:text and xsl:value-of
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: pr-2301
:END:
See PR [[https://qt4cg.org/dashboard/#pr-2301][#2301]].

+ MK: We had an external requirement to support this feature.
  + … I tried with a PI, but NW observed that was problematic.
  + … Here, I’ve added a ~cdata~ attribute to ~xsl:text~ and ~xsl:value-of~.
  + … It’s expressed as an intent, and may be ignored.
+ NW: Much better. It’ll still get lost across successive transformations.
  + … Is there any potential here for annotating the actual ~text()~ node?
+ MK: We could, but then you’d have to define what happens to anything that
  operates on text nodes, for example what do you do with adjacent text nodes?
+ JWL: If a text node is in a variable, you’re saying anything could happen.
+ MK: An implementation could potentially store text nodes with a bit that
  indicates if ~cdata~ is requested.
  + … But I’m saying it’s only really likely to work if you pass it directly to
    a serializer.
+ JK: Looks good and interesting. Where there any updates needed for what to do
  with serialization?
+ MK: No, we haven’t made this a property of the text node. Sequence
  normalization will merge text nodes. I’ve basically left that largely
  unspecified.
+ JK: So if you have three text nodes that are adjacent, and only the middle has
  the ~cdata~ attributes, what should I expect?
+ MK: At the moment, I’m honoring that and only putting the middle one in a CDATA section.
  + … There’s still complexity here, what to do with combining characters.
  + … I don’t think we want to specify all that.
+ WP: I like this a lot. I think it’s okay that this is like disable-output-escaping.
  + … There’s a bit of adjacency here with character mapping.

Some discussion of character mapping.

+ MK: I wouldn’t expect the CDATA tags themselves to be subject to character mapping!
  + … Maybe we need a bit more detail, but I’d like to keep it a bit hand wavy.

ACTION QT4CG-144-02: MK to add notes about edge cases: sequence normalization and character maps for example.

Proposal: accept this PR.

Accepted.

** PR #2281: 2280 Usability of xsl:array-member
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: pr-2281
:END:
See PR [[https://qt4cg.org/dashboard/#pr-2281][#2281]].

+ MK: These changes came from attempts to write tests and finding cases where it
  produced the wrong answer. I made spec changes in response to the usability
  experience of writing test cases. It’s also in response to comments on the
  original proposal.
+ MK: I’ve introduced the term ~parcel~ again.
  + … The parcel simplifies the polymorphism in the array instruction.
  + … It’s now a dynamic error if you mix ordinary items and ~xsl:array-member~ instructions.

MK walks through the examples.

+ JWL: In the for-each example that has apply-templates inside it:

#+begin_src xml
<xsl:array for-each="*">
  <xsl:apply-templates select="."/>
</xsl:array>
#+end_src

+ MK: There are two things it can do is create ordinary nodes or a single array member.
+ JWL: But it can’t produce two array members.
+ MK: That’s right.
+ JWL: The heterogenous problem only applies when you use for-each.

Proposal: accept this PR.

Accepted.

** PR #2319: 2311 Change default XSLT pattern priorities
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: pr-2319
:END:
See PR [[https://qt4cg.org/dashboard/#pr-2319][#2319]].

+ MK: When I wrote the issue, I thought there was a simple typo. But I
  discovered that for type patterns there was previous work that attempted to
  make the type patterns depend on the placement of the type in the hierarchy.
  + … But that makes ~xsl:next-match~ really complex.

MK reviews the priorities in the current proposal, section 6.3.3.2.

+ MK: The conflict resolution rules are simplified.

+ WP: I like it too. I wonder if there are any edge cases where we need to be
  able to find the default priority values?
+ MK: It would be useful for writing tests!
  + … I XSLT, you have to bracket it with priorities above and below and make
    sure ~xsl:next-match~ does the right thing.

Proposal: accept this PR.

Accepted.
