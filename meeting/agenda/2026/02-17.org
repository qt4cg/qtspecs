** Improvements to FOS

See PR [[https://qt4cg.org/dashboard/#pr-2457][#2457]] Improved use of fos:result, and
PR [[https://qt4cg.org/dashboard/#pr-2456][#2456]]: Stylesheet handling of fos:result/@narrative

** Issue #2460: file:read-text and invalid XML characters
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-D51FB09C-1C0E-4C5A-8D3E-15DF1BD60FA7
:END:

See issue [[https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/2460][#2460]]: file:read-text and invalid XML characters

Perhaps we can decide what needs to be done here.

** Other issue triage
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-CAC3A474-CC59-4E99-9508-DED1B7DC26C7
:END:

Proposals for how to proceed most humbly solicited. In the absense of any such
proposal, I think a good first step would be to look over the 78 open issues and
divide them into “required for 4.0” and “nice to have” and perhaps even “close
with no further action.” Any we can’t decide on, we can just leave for another
day.
