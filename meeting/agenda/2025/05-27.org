** What about fn:chain?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-061025D7-C926-499B-A5CC-B6B436C704BC
:END:

We had a couple of meetings discussing the proposal to replace ~fn:chain~ with
~fn:compose~. The PR for discussion this week simply removes ~fn:chain~. (In
previous straw polls, no one preferred “only fn:chain”; this PR changes the
status quo to reflect that.)

I don’t expect there’s a lot of new technical ground to cover here, so we’ll
attempt to time box the discussion. Ultimately, I hope the CG can express a
clear consensus and that everyone in the minority can accept that consensus.

See PR [[https://qt4cg.org/dashboard/#pr-1984][#1984]]: 882 Drop fn:chain, and PR [[https://qt4cg.org/dashboard/#pr-1894][#1894]]: Additional examples to fn:chain
