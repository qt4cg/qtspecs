* Technical agenda
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: technical-agenda
:END:

We do need to get back to issue triage, but in the interest of “catching up”,
let’s plan to focus on PRs this week. I’ve tried to order them with the “easy”
ones first, but suggestions for reordering a perfectly in order. (No pun
intended.)

I don’t actually think we’ll get through all of these, but let’s try to
prioritize finishing the small ones over discussing the big ones where
practical.
