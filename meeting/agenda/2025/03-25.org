:CUSTOM_ID: agenda
:END:

This meeting will be hosted on Zoom at 16:00GMT (17:00CET, 12:00EDT) 

The [[https://us06web.zoom.us/j/83199966275?pwd=SmN6V0RhUGdSTHFHZkd6cjgxVEY2QT09][Zoom meeting]] ID is 831 9996 6275; the passcode is 707664.

See the [[https://qt4cg.org/meeting/logistics.html][meeting logistics]] page for more details.

Note: The QT4CG meeting is scheduled on UK/European civil time. The United
States switched to daylight saving time on 9 March 2025, so the meeting of
25 March will be one hour later there (12:00 EDT, 09:00 PDT) until the
UK/Europe also switches (on 30 March 2025).

This meeting is planned for 25 March 2025. The following meeting is scheduled

Note: The QT4CG meeting is scheduled on UK/European civil time. The
United States switched to daylight saving time on 9 March 2025 and the
UK/Europe switches on 30 March 2025. Consequently, the 1 April meeting
will be back to the “usual” time in North America (no fooling!).
