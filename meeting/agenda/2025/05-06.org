+ PR [[https://qt4cg.org/dashboard/#pr-1894][#1894]]: Additional examples to fn:chain - in a new branch

We need to come to some resolution on this issue. Recall that in last week’s
straw poll, there were only two options that got any votes at all: fn:compose
(only) got 6 votes, both got 3 votes.

I’m going to time box this discussion to 10 minutes. If, after that time, there
is still a substantial majority in favor of fn:compose only, I’m going to ask
the minority to accept that the consensus does not favor keeping fn:chain as
well.
