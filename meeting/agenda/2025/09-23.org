** FYI: the path to standardization…
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-D3B23E1A-D8D5-4665-BFFA-CA6AD0E02FEC
:END:

The W3C held a meeting about Community Groups recently. One observation
from that meeting is that the W3C does not consider Community Groups to be an
appropriate place to do standards work. They’re envisioned as incubators that
lead to the formation of regular Working Groups or migration of the work to
another standards development organization.

I pointed out that there is no W3C Activity for XML-related standardization. One
place to discuss this would be at the Technical Plenary but that’s in Kobe,
Japan this year and I don’t think anyone in this CG is planning to go. (It will
be in Dublin, Ireland next year and I will plan to go.)

More discussion, with an eye towards forming a Working Group is expected in the
following months. I have no prediction about how that will proceed.
