Is there an implied constraint on the order of evaluation? The spec appears to suggest so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>its expression will be evaluated after the expressions of the try clause and a possibly evaluated catch clause.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does <strong>evaluated after</strong> actually mean in a functional language? I can't see how to reconcile this with the general principles of the language regarding lazy evaluation etc. Is there some kind of exception to the general rule that you only have to evaluate as much of an expression as is needed to work out what the result is going to be?</p>
<p>It seems to me that the hidden unstated purpose of "finally" is to execute expressions that have side-effects, and without a proper semantic framework for handling side-effects, this is going to get us into trouble.</p>

<pre><code class="language-xquery">declare record local:r(
    f as fn() as item()
);

local:r(%method fn() {.})
? f()
=&gt; map:keys()
</code></pre>
<p>With a method passed to the constructor, and retrieved by the lookup operator, one would expect the function call to return the map, and the result to be <code>f</code>, the set of keys of the map. With BaseX's current implementation however, it fails with <code>[XPDY0002] .: Context value is undefined.</code></p>
<p>The reason for this failure is function coercion. The record constructor asks for a more specific type than that of the supplied function, so it is subject to function coercion. This creates a new function item, which preserves the method annotation, and which effects a call to the original one. The lookup operator then is applied to the newly created function item, which as a method is equipped with the map as its context item. But when the original function gets called, that context item is not propagated to it. So there is a (rightful?) complaint about an undefined context.</p>
<p>I may be missing something here, but I do not see anything in the spec that makes the context item available to the coerced function, so I think that the described behavior is in fact conformant to the spec.</p>
<p>But as it contradicts the original expectation, I would be grateful for a clarification.</p>
