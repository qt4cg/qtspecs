<div class="toot" id="created-2216"><h2>Issue #2216 created<span class="toot-id"> #created-2216</span></h2><div class="pubdate">29 Sep at 07:31:17 GMT</div><div class="link">Link: <a href="https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/2216">https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/2216</a></div><details><summary>Make all data types ordered</summary><div class="markup"><p>No ordering is defined for the types <code>QName</code>, <code>NOTATION</code>, <code>gY</code>, <code>gYM</code>, <code>gM</code>, <code>gMD</code>, <code>gD</code>.</p>
<p>There seems no good reason for this restriction; it's perfectly easy to define an intuitive ordering for all these types (handliing timezones as we do for <code>xs:date</code> etc). In the case of QNames we sort first by URI then by local-name.</p>
<p>I propose that we remove the restriction.</p>
<p>This would make the types eligible for inclusion in functions such as <code>sort</code>, <code>min</code>, <code>max</code>, <code>highest</code>, <code>lowest</code>, <code>compare</code>, <code>xsl:merge</code> etc</p>
<p>With this, we can change the table for value comparisons so that instead of two separate supporting functions (e.g. <code>op:boolean-equal</code> and <code>op:boolean-less-than</code>) we have a single supporting function <code>op:boolean-compare</code>.</p>

<p>I believe there should be a note attached at the very top of the function description, ideally within the summary, along the lines of: "For conversion of arbitrary XML trees to JSON, see <code>element-to-map()</code>."</p>
<p>I tried to do this myself, attaching a note to <code>&lt;fos:summary&gt;</code> in the function catalog. But the schema yelled at me, so I thought it best to start an issue, to see how best to set up a cross-reference structure.</p>
<p>We will need a similar top-level xref at the entry <code>json-to-xml()</code> pointing to <code>map-to-element()</code>, if/when it is created per #1962</p>

<p>However, a useful step I think would be to move streaming into a separate specification document.</p>
<p>I think this would be useful for readers; it would put all the information in one place, it would make it much clearer that the feature is an optional addition to the spec, and it would mean that those who aren't interested in it wouldn't be distracted by it.</p>
<p>But on a project planning level, it would have another big benefit: it would reduce the risk that finishing the work on streaming could jeopardise the whole project. It would become quite feasible to declare XSLT 4.0 complete even though the work on defining streaming is unfinished. This could potentially speed up completion of XSLT 4.0 by a year. Removing this risk is particularly important as there are few people on the project who understand the area really well.</p>

<p>It's an unnecessary burden on implementors to require them to provide two different ways of doing this. And I can't see that always including the content creates any problems for users.</p>
<p>The current Note suggests that the way an implementation behaves might depend on what architectural approach it is adopting to process the HTML. That in turn suggests that to support both options it might need to adopt a choice of architectural approaches depending on the option chosen: in other words, that the processor needs to implement two completely different approaches to implementing the function. That would indeed be a serious burden.</p>
<p>If there really are implementation difficulties in providing one approach rather than the other, then I think the right answer is to make the choice implementation-defined rather than making it a user option.</p>

<p>The change was made primarily for consistency with parse-xml() and parse-html(). However, those functions have a legitimate reason to accept binary input, because discerning the encoding may be intermingled with parsing in the case of input documents that use custom syntax to define their own encoding. This is not the case for CSV and JSON, where standard decoding tools may be used.</p>

<p>See also #675 and #2128</p>
<p>The main reason for this is that I don't think we have the resources to do it. I don't think we're likely to find anyone other than me who will step up to the task; and if I attempt it I'm not sure we will find people willing and able to check my work, which is essential because it's devilishly difficult to get the detail right. We have added a lot of new features to the 4.0 spec without applying any thought to their streamability. The introduction of JNodes probably means quite a few rules need to be extended or qualified.</p>
<p>With the demise of Abel Braaksma's Exselt, Saxon is the only streaming processor available. As far as I can tell, streaming is not widely used: I'm sure we would get a lot more support requests and bug reports if it were, because it's difficult to write streamable code and I know that our implementation is fairly fragile. If the CG were to define all the streamability rules for new 4.0 constructs, I'm not sure we would be able to justify the resources to implement them.</p>
<p>In principle we could deprecate the language constructs associated with streaming from the spec and say that the effect of these constructs is implementation-defined.</p>
<p>There is precedent for this with the XQuery Update Facility. This wasn't carried forward to 3.0 partly because of lack of volunteers to do the work, and partly because of differences of opinion about what direction the spec should take. Implementors have found their own ways around the problem.</p>
