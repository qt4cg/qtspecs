The <code>xsl:message</code> instruction is unhelpful here, because if the "wrong" template rule is firing, you don't know where to add the message. And the only other standardised debugging aids are <code>fn:trace()</code> and <code>xsl:assert</code>, which don't help either.</p>
<p>I propose an attribute on <code>xsl:apply-templates</code>, <code>xsl:apply-imports</code>, and <code>xsl:next-match</code>: trace=yes|no. If enabled, execution of the instruction causes a message to be output (as if by xsl:message) identifying the rule that is invoked, in an implementation-defined way. In the case that a built-in template rule is invoked, the message should indicate this, and any implicit apply-templates performed by the built-in rule should be evaluated as if it specified trace="yes". It is "recommended" that the message output should identify the stylesheet module, line number, match pattern, and mode, if the information is available, and should also include a representation of the item that is being processed by the instruction, for example the node kind and name.</p>

<p>It is currently applied, for demonstration purposes, to changes made in the serialization spec.</p>
<p>More specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added the <code>changes</code> and <code>change</code> elements to the DTD; <code>changes</code> is an optional element that follows <code>head</code> within any section</li>
<li>Changed the XSLT stylesheets and CSS to render the <code>changes</code> element, and to add a flag to the TOC entry if a <code>changes</code> element is present</li>
<li>Added specimen <code>changes</code> elements to the seriallization spec</li>
</ul>
<p>There's a lot more to be done:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate an aggregated list of changes in an appendix</li>
<li>Improve the CSS rendition</li>
<li>Toggle change markings on and off; browse forward and backward through changed sections</li>
<li>Add the <code>changes</code> data to the other specs</li>
</ul>

At the same time, automated diff markup tends to give a lot of unwanted detail, highlighting changes that are purely editorial.</p>
<p>I propose that we try out an alternative approach. Each section/subsection with significant changes should start with an info box listing the changes, headed "Changes in 4.0". This should be rendered with a distinct colour or border to make it recognisable, and it should be possible to toggle whether the changes are shown or hidden. Changes that represent an incompatibility should be specially marked, perhaps with a device such as a warning triangle. A Δ marker (or colour highlighting) could appear in the table of contents against any section that has a <code>changes</code> entry.</p>
<p>Internally, the changes should be identified with custom markup: I suggest an optional <code>&lt;changes&gt;</code> element immediately after <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, with a sequence of <code>&lt;change&gt;</code> children, each of which should contain administrative metadata (such as a link to the issue and/or PR) as well as user-readable text.</p>
<p>For changes to F+O functions, corresponding elements should be added to the FOS catalog schema; this should replace (or generate) the current "History" section.</p>

<p>Given an array such as <code>[1, 2, 3]</code>, the values within that array cannot easily be extracted. With the current version of XPath and XQuery, they need to be assigned to a temporary variable first. For example:</p>
<pre><code>let $result := get-camera-point()
let $x := $result?(1)
let $y := $result?(2)
let $z := $result?(3)
return "(" || $x || "," || $y || "," || $z || ")"
</code></pre>
<p>This proposal would allow this to be written more concisely as:</p>
<pre><code>let [$x, $y, $z] := get-camera-point()
return "(" || $x || "," || $y || "," || $z || ")"
</code></pre>
<p>These are equivalent in this proposal, except that <code>$result</code> is not a statically known variable binding in the array decomposition let clause.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: The older syntax in <a href="https://github.com/expath/xpath-ng/pull/8">XPath-NG</a> was:</p>
<p>let $[x, y, z] := get-camera-point()
return "(" || $x || "," || $y || "," || $z || ")"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For each variable declaration in the array decomposition at index <code>N</code>, and <code>$expr</code> being the result of the for/let expression, then <code>$expr?(N)</code> is the value bound to the variable declaration as a new variable binding. If the value does not exist, an <code>err:FOAY0001</code> (array index out of bounds) error will be raised.</p>
<p>An array decomposition can be used in any for or let clause binding to decompose the items in an array. If the type of the for or let clause binding expression is not a sequence, an <code>err:XPTY0004</code> error is raised.</p>
<h3>Assigning the rest of an array</h3>
<p>It can be useful to only extract part of an array (e.g. the heading of a table), and store the rest of the items in another variable. For example:</p>
<pre><code>let $(heading as array(xs:string), rows as array(xs:string)...) :=
    load-csv("test.csv")
</code></pre>
<p>If there are no items remaining in the array the result is an empty array.</p>
<h3>Influences</h3>
<p>Tuple decomposition is found in various languages such as Python, Scala, and C#. These languages also have support for tuple types.</p>
<p>Python has support for specifying that a variable is assigned the remaining values in the tuple.</p>
<h2>Use Cases</h2>
<p>There are many cases where fixed size sequences may be used such as points, complex and rational numbers, sin/cos, and mul/div. This makes extracting data from these simpler, and may also be used to aid readability by assigning descriptive names to each of the items in the sequence.</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>Extracting values from an array:</p>
<pre><code>declare function sincos($angle as xs:double?) {
    [ math:sin($angle), math:cos($angle) ]

let $angle := math:pi()

<p>This makes it tricky to take advantage of choice types for extending existing functions in a backwards-compatible way. For example, we might want to change the second argument of fn:unparsed-text from <code>$encoding as xs:string</code> to <code>$options as (xs:string | map(*))</code>. But under the current rules, this means the supplied value of the $encoding argument will no longer be atomized.</p>
<p>I propose to change this by effectively promoting rule 3 to appear before rule 2. Rule 2 is the atomization rule, and rule 3 is the new rule:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If R is a [choice item type] <em>that is not a [generalized atomic type]</em>, then the following rules are applied with R set to each of the alternatives in the choice item type, in order, until an alternative is found that does not result in a type error; a type error is raised only if all alternatives fail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The phrase in italics is deleted.</p>
<p>The effect is that if the required type is <code>(xs:string | map(*))</code> then we first try converting the supplied argument as if the required type were <code>xs:string</code> (including atomization), and if that fails we try converting it as if the required type were map(*).</p>
