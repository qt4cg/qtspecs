<div class="toot" id="created-2051"><h2>Issue #2051 created<span class="toot-id"> #created-2051</span></h2><div class="pubdate">14 Jun at 01:37:09 GMT</div><div class="link">Link: <a href="https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/2051">https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/2051</a></div><details><summary>XSLT group by cluster</summary><div class="markup"><p>I propose an enhancement of <code>xsl:for-each-group</code> to support clustering.</p>
<p>To start off with a simple use case, suppose one has the following population, <code>&lt;xsl:variable name="ages" as="xs:integer*" select="5, 24, 9, 5, 6, 8, 36, 38, 28"/&gt;</code> and one wishes to cluster the figures like so, in four groups: <code>(5, 5, 6, 8, 9)</code>, <code>(24)</code>, <code>(28)</code>, <code>(36, 38)</code>.</p>
<p>One is tempted to create an <code>&lt;xsl:for-each-group&gt;</code> with <code>group-by="((. - 1) to (. + 1))"</code>. But this does not work. If <code>@composite</code> is absent or is <code>no</code>, eighteen groups are created. If <code>@composite</code> is <code>yes</code>, eight groups are created. In both cases, the results are not significantly close to the desired output.</p>
<p>I propose a new <code>@group-by-cluster</code>. The following code</p>
<pre><code>&lt;xsl:for-each-group select="$ages" group-by-cluster="((. - 1) to (. + 1))"&gt;
    &lt;xsl:sort select="current-grouping-key()"/&gt;
    &lt;group key="{current-grouping-key()}" count="{count(current-group())}"&gt;
        &lt;xsl:copy-of select="current-group()"/&gt;
    &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/xsl:for-each-group&gt; 
</code></pre>
<p>would produce this</p>
<pre><code>   &lt;group key="4 5 6 7 8 9 10" count="2"&gt;5 5 6 8 9&lt;/group&gt;
   &lt;group key="23 24 25" count="1"&gt;24&lt;/group&gt;
   &lt;group key="27 28 29" count="1"&gt;28&lt;/group&gt;
   &lt;group key="35 36 37 38 39" count="1"&gt;36 38&lt;/group&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>There are numerous use cases for the proposed new feature. Here are a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clustering map or spatial coordinates</li>
<li>Grouping disparate rectangles from OCR output</li>
<li>Reconciling triples in linked open data (RDF) that use different IRIs synonymously</li>
<li>Detecting typologies within in large corpora of documents that have periodically repetitive formulaic paragraphs.</li>
<li>Discovering networks of connected things, e.g., networks of email correspondence or publication citations
&nbsp;
Currently, the clustering I describe above is feasible in XSLT, but it requires creative strategies, usually a combination of preprocessing and the creation of specialized helper functions to recursively iterate over multiple grouping keys to create group numbers. These are challenging to write and debug, and one loses identity in a preprocessed copy of the original.</li>
</ul>
<p>By putting clustering into a <code>@group-by-cluster</code> construct, users benefit not only from convenience but also from performance, as a processor might bring novel strategies for clustering.</p>
<p>The <code>current-grouping-key()</code> for a group would consist of a sequence of all members' grouping keys, duplicates removed. No two groups would have any overlap in their grouping key sequences. (That's the definition of a cluster.)</p>
<p><code>@group-by-cluster</code> would have effect only if its value actually produced a sequence of length greater than one, and if <code>@composite</code> is no. (Should a user should be warned if <code>@composite</code> is yes?)</p>

<p>Untrusted execution seems to me to be one of the biggest security issues for XSLT/XQuery and XPath in general, and I think it’s important to make the distinction between untrusted execution where an untrusted stylesheet or query is executed (perhaps via Saxon’s <code>XsltCompiler.compile()</code>), and when a trusted stylesheet or query causes untrusted code to be executed, as with <code>fn:parse-xml()</code>, <code>fn:doc()</code>, <code>fn:transform()</code> and <code>&lt;xsl:evaluate&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>The proposals in #2034 address one case, but have no effect on the other, and that raises the question of what would happen if an untrusted (unsafe) stylesheet executed <code>fn:doc()</code> with <code>safe = true</code>.</p>
<p>I would like to see the specs address the security implications of untrusted execution more explicitly, and to provide clearer guidance for implementation authors around both completely untrusted code, and trusted code which executes untrusted code.</p>
<p>I think that could take the form of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Annotation of all functions that have potentially problematic external effects (primarily file / resource access).</li>
<li>Clear expectations for implementors about what (and how) security restrictions should be configurable.</li>
<li>Consistent Error codes for security-related exceptions</li>
<li>Consistent security-related options for functions which can cause untrusted source parsing or code execution.</li>
<li>A additional security section in the spec under section 2 (Concepts / Basics) in the XSLT/XQuery/XPath specs, and section 1 of XPFO, which collects the overview and points to what to look for in the rest of the spec.</li>
</ul>

<p>The spec makes mention of ‘available documents’, ‘available text resources’, ‘available binary resources’, ‘available collections’, and ‘available URI collections’.</p>
<p>The documentation for <code>fn:doc()</code>, <code>fn:collection()</code>, and <code>fn:uri-collection()</code> mention an error (<code>err:FODC0002</code>) to be raised if the URI requested is not in the relevant ‘available X’  (although there is some disagreement about what the ‘X’ should be - we have ‘available node collections’ and ‘available resource collections’ mentioned in the function docs). <code>fn:unparsed-text()</code> and <code>fn:unparsed-binary()</code> do not.</p>
<p>I think the documented behaviour of <code>fn:unparsed-text()</code> and <code>fn:unparsed-binary()</code> should be brought into line with the others.</p>

<p>Ignoring JNodes for now, I don't think the change would make any observable difference to the language syntax or semantics. It changes the way that a predicate is interpreted : <code>..[P]</code> becomes a regular filter expression and is no longer subject to the special rules for predicates within steps; but the only difference is how position() is interpreted, and since <code>..</code> can only return a singleton, this makes no difference.</p>
<p>For JNodes it means we will be able to write expressions such as <code>$my-map??x[..?y = 3]</code> rather than <code>$my-map??x[?parent::*?y = 3]</code></p>

<p>It seems to me that if the context value is an empty sequence, no type error should be raised; the effect of <code>() -&gt; name()</code> should be the same as <code>name(())</code>.</p>

<p>there is no changes entry flagging the fact that the coercion rules are now applied (and corresponding test cases such as contextDecl-037a do not identity a PR). The relevant PR is PR #254 .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The statement "<em>The context value declaration has the effect of setting the context value static type T in the static context.</em>" is incorrect. The static context no longer includes a context value static type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The statement "<em>In all cases where the context value has a value, that value must match the type T according to the rules for SequenceType matching</em>" is incorrect (or at least, misleading): as stated two paragraphs later, coercion is applied. But because there can be multiple context value declarations in different modules, specifying different types, perhaps the intent is that coercion is applied only to a value supplied in the query, and not to a value supplied externally? If so, this needs clarifying. There are apparently no tests for coercing an externally-supplied value to the required type.</p>

The default mode is defined by the nearest containing instruction that has a <code>[xsl:]default-mode</code> attribute.</p>
<p>I would like to drop this dependency.</p>
<p>Most of the cases where a function call depends on the static context (especially an XSLT function) are cases where the relevant property is fixed for a package (e.g. the set of named keys, decimal formats, or character maps). There are places where there is a dependency on something tha can vary in a more fine-grained way - notably (a) the default collation, and (b) the set of namespace bindings, but on the whole such dependencies are undesirable (a) because they introduce opportunities for user error (e.g. when copying and pasting code) and (b) because they increase the amount of information the processor has to keep around at runtime just in case it is needed (for example, in a dynamic function call). I would therefore like to avoid introducing this dependency.</p>
<p>The proposed change is (a) to drop "#default" as a value of the <code>mode</code> option for this function, and (b) to say that if no mode is specified by <code>fn:apply-templates</code> the unnamed mode is used.</p>

Instead, we now have two specific options (allow-external-entities, entity-expansion-limit) that need to be explicitly assigned to make parsing safer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to parse certain XML documents, like <a href="https://dblp.org/xml/dblp.xml.gz"><code>dblp..xml.gz</code></a>, more than one JDK 11 limit needs to be increased:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>http://www.oracle.com/xml/jaxp/properties/entityExpansionLimit
http://www.oracle.com/xml/jaxp/properties/maxGeneralEntitySizeLimit
http://www.oracle.com/xml/jaxp/properties/totalEntitySizeLimit
</code></pre>
<p>As we have observed, XML parsing depends on the specific XML parsers. I believe it would be more user-friendly to replace the specific settings with a single option <code>safe</code>, and to let the processor decide which properties are assigned:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>true</code> (default): Avoid XXE and billion laughs attacks</li>
<li><code>false</code>: disable safe parsing (increase limits, allow parsing of external resources)</li>
</ol>
