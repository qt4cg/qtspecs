<hr>
<p>Inspired by #720 and concerns regarding usability and performance, it may be a big step, but couldn’t we define records as subtypes of maps?</p>
<ul>
<li>The main difference would be that updates on records are only allowed as long as the resulting map matches a record definition.</li>
<li>This would allow us to return much better error messages, and to prevent users from deconstructing their own data structures.</li>
<li>We could still benefit from the existing map functions… provided that we believe it's an advantage. A stricter solution would be to disallow optional map entries completely (and treating records as a separate type).</li>
<li>From a technical point of view, data with a fixed structure can be optimized much better than a structure that changes dynamically.</li>

The prose leads the reader to expect frequent invocation of this tree example, but chap. 13 never uses it.</p>
<p>Chapter 13's tree example is referred to (sans link) and summarized in the preamble of chap. 14. In that chapter it is used only once, in a <code>fn:count</code> example that really doesn't rely upon anything special in the tree example.</p>
<p>Variables <code>$item1</code> and <code>$item2</code> are invoked only once more: in chap. 4, for <code>fn:number</code>. It's rather out of the blue, because neither the function definition nor chapter 4's preamble say anything about what the variables mean.</p>
<p>My recommendation is to drop this material all together, and for the functions <code>fn:count</code> and <code>fn:number</code> replace the examples with simpler examples.</p>
<p>OTOH, I might have come across an incomplete implementation, and the editors might prefer to make more thorough use of this tree example. I don't know.</p>

<p>I think the point that led to this was the fact that the word "promotion" seems inappropriate for cases like (string/uri) where the implicit conversion can take place in either direction.</p>
<p>I'd like to propose a fix to this that is not merely editorial. I propose that we allow any cast from one numeric type to another in the coercion rules. For example, if the required type is decimal, then a double or float can be supplied. Since, for many implementations of xs:decimal, this can be done losslessly, it makes at least as much sense to convert from double to decimal as from decimal to double.</p>
<p>The word "promotion" is in fact used (in relation to the coercion rules) only in a table heading, and we can change this heading to "implicit casting".</p>
<p>Appendix B.1 currently says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>B.1 Type Promotion</p>
<p>[Definition: Under certain circumstances, an atomic value can be promoted from one type to another.] Type promotion is used in a number of contexts:</p>
<p>It forms part of the process described by the [coercion rules], invoked for example when a value of one type is supplied as an argument of a function call where the required type of the corresponding function parameter is declared with a different type.
It forms part of the process described in [B.2 Operator Mapping]), which selects the implementation of a binary operator based on the types of the supplied operands.
It is invoked (by explicit reference) in a number of other situations, for example when computing an average of a sequence of numeric values (in the fn:avg function).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and I suggest we retain the term only for the second case, operator mapping. This differs from the coercion rules in that there are two operands and the effect is always to convert one to the type of the other. This affects numeric types only (not string/uri or binary), and it will continue to promote decimal to double, decimal to float, and float to double.</p>
<p>Where functions (fn:avg, fn:sum, math:pow) refer to the promotion rules, I suggest that we spell out the conversions that happen explictly, since it's not entirely obvious how the rules should be extrapolated. (For example, fn:avg doesn't make it entirely clear what should happen if the first item is a decimal, the second is a float, and the third is a double. Are you expected to "look ahead" to see what types are present, rather than evaluating the average incrementally?)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>After a couple of weeks of discussion[1][2] about naming things, there
seem to be a some quite different perspectives on the problem.</p>
<p>As background, let’s remember that we have a language (or a set of
languages) that evolved over time. We couldn’t anticipate in version
1.0 what we would have in 4.0. We added new features in 2.0 and 3.0
that weren’t anticipated in previous versions either.</p>
<p>We live with decisions (some the result of long and hard battles
within the working group(s)) like the fact that sequences don’t nest
so all individual items are also sequences of length one.</p>
<p>The context for each addition to the language has been roughly: how
can we add new, useful features with a minimum of backwards
incompatibility.</p>
<p>It’s a natural consequence of this sort of evolution that there are
rough edges. Why does fn:count returns the number of items in a
sequence but always returns 1 if the argument is an array? Because an
array is an item and an item is a sequence of length one.</p>
<p>(It doesn’t help that the vision of what the X* languages should be
has changed over time. What started out envisioned as a tool for
transforming documents from one format to another for presentation on
the web or in print has grown into something that at least some
members of the group view as first class, functional programming
languages. That’s not bad, but it puts entirely different stresses on
the design, I think.)</p>
<p>As we add new functions (specifically, in the case of recent
discussions, but I expect the same perspectives apply more generally),
I think one perspective is roughly this:</p>
<p>How can we name and organize the functions so that users are least
likely to be surprised and most likely to be able to figure out how
to solve a particular problem?</p>
<p>Taken to an extreme, this perspective isn’t about changing the
semantics of the functions at all, it’s “just” about naming them. Is
fn:get() better (easier to understand, less confusing) than
fn:items-at?</p>
<p>I think another perspective is roughly this:</p>
<p>We have a messy design. It would be better if we could refactor the
design so that it was more harmonious and logical. We don’t need
four different, closely related functions to get items out of
different sorts of data structures, we need a set of abstractions
that make it obvious that only one function is necessary.</p>
<p>Taken to an extreme, this perspective is about reshaping the whole
language so that a single, obvious set of function names emerges
naturally from the carefully constructed abstractions.</p>
<p>I don’t think anyone holds exactly one perspective (discussions about
renaming often involve some level of discussion about semantics, for
example) and I’m attempting to polarize the perspectives a little bit
in an effort to shine light on a larger problem, not to be divisive.</p>
<p>With my chair’s hat on, the main problem I see with the first
perspective is that naming is hard, often personal and emotional, and
will never be wholly logical (so there will always be more to discuss,
so the “problem” is never resolved). It’s not quite fair to say it’s a
distraction from the “bigger” issues we need to resolve, but it does
take a lot of time.</p>
<p>I see the appeal of the second perspective. If we had a green field,
we’d do things differently. I think we might all agree that, ideally,
fn:count should return the number of items in a sequence, the number
of items in an array, and the number of key-value pairs in a map. But
it doesn’t and it can’t without fundamentally breaking things. I don’t
think we’d get agreement to break fn:count, so what can we do?</p>
<p>A proposal to fundamentally redesign the data model would be a tough
sell, I think.</p>
<p>One thing we could do is define a new namespace “gn” with functions
that work more logically, that treat sequences, arrays, and maps, as
collections and operate on them uniformly.</p>
<p>I suppose we could reconstruct the whole set of functions in this new
namespace and focus our efforts there, perhaps going so far as to
deprecate the current fn: namespace in favor of this new one.
But could we get consensus to do that? Would users thank us?</p>
<p>I dunno. Innovations welcome.</p>
<pre><code>                                    Be seeing you,
                                      norm
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This issue addresses the 2nd alternative formulated briefly by Norm as:</p>
<blockquote>

collections and operate on them uniformly.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Here are some of the obvious advantages of having a uniform Kollection concept that covers: arrays, sequences, maps, ... and possibly future new, specific, collection-like datatypes as sets:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Uniform definition and understanding of a single data type - the Kollection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O(N) functions only, compared to O(M * N) at present. Here N is the number of functions needed for each of the current collection-like data types (Arrays, Sequences and Maps) and M is the number of collection-like data types (currently 3).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The users will need to know about and understand just the single Kollection data type and its functions, not 3 or more similar collection-like data  types and 3 or more number of similar (but different) functions. Minimizing by a factor of 3 the amount of factual knowledge that a user needs is something HUGE  and extremely positive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allowing users to say "Good Bye" to the unclear and treacherous flat-sequence concepts we have as legacy from XPath 1.0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Staying aligned to the examples of other modern programming languages such as C# with its IEnumerable interface. It is good to know that this has already been done in other shining programming languages, thus a nay-sayer will not be able to argue that this is not doable or, if done, would be negative to the language and its users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Freeing enormous resources and time for the members of the Community Group so that they can spend this on more valuable avenues, than trying to find similar and best names to M similar functions each defined to one of the M current collection-like data types.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, to dispel some plausible myths before they start circulating here:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Myth 1: This will break backwards-compatibility? No, as proposed by Norm, all the functions operating on the generalized collection data type can be in a separate, new namespace and thus no existing user-code is affected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Myth 2: If a sequence containing a single Kollection still has <code>count()</code> of 1, then what is the use of the Kollection data type? Actually, as proposed by Norm, the Kollection data type and its functions reside in their own namespace. Doing things using only functions from this new namespace eliminates the possibility of using <code>fn:count</code> as it resides in the different, currently existing standard function namespace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Myth 3: This will be too-complex for the users and the users will not embrace it, so let us not waste time designing it. Wow, there were such prophets saying exactly the same about LINQ in 2005. As it often happens, the future proved them wrong. Users clearly and overwhelmingly "voted with their code" incorporating LINQ in almost all everyday applications and code repositories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Myth 4: Banning the current functions operating on sequences, arrays and maps would be a huge burden to the users, and would intervene negatively with their programming. In fact, nobody would be banning any of the existing functions. Users can continue to use them forever. The acceptance of the uniform and generalized Kollection data - type can happen gradually with time, as was the case with the addition of LINQ to C#.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3><a href="https://qt4cg.org/specifications/xpath-datamodel-40/Overview.html#function-items">XDM, 2.9.4 Function Items</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>identity</strong>: an abstract property that can be used to test whether two variables refer to the same function or to different functions. This property is exposed only for this purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Currently, the concept of function identity is used for two purposes: firstly, when functions appear in the arguments supplied to the <code>fn:deep-equal</code> function; and secondly, in establishing whether the arguments and results of a function are "the same" when deciding whether the function is deterministic.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Function identity is not currently defined for maps and arrays, because in the circumstances where function identity would otherwise be used, maps and arrays are compared by examining their content.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://qt4cg.org/specifications/xpath-functions-40/Overview.html#properties-of-functions">XQFO, 1.8.4 Properties of functions</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li>[…] the two function items have the same function identity. The concept of function identity is explained in Section 2.9.4 Function Items.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://qt4cg.org/specifications/xpath-functions-40/Overview.html#func-deep-equal">XQFO, 14.2.8 fn:deep-equal</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>c. <code>$i1</code> and <code>$i2</code> have the same function identity. The concept of function identity is explained in Section 2.9.4 Function Items.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://qt4cg.org/specifications/xpath-functions-40/Overview.html#func-function-lookup">XQFO, 17.1.1 fn:function-lookup</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The function identity is determined in the same way as for a named function reference. Specifically, if there is no context dependency, two calls on <code>fn:function-lookup</code> with the same name and arity must return the same function.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While I definitely believe in the concept, I believe the documentation is still cryptic, or even impossible, to understand, at least without reading #520 or consuming the existing QT4 test cases. Here are some questions that I’m trying to answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does “abstract property” mean that the property will not be materialized in an implementation, or does it mean that the property too vague to be precisely defined?</li>
<li>We should try to specify what “refer to the same function” means. Are function properties that allow us to at least safely identify a subset of functions the same? For example, will <code>true#0</code> and <code>true#0</code> always be identical? The test cases imply this, whereas #520 doesn’t.</li>
<li>In XQFO 17.1.1, there’s a hint that context-dependency influences the decision if functions are identified as equal. Does this mean that <code>name#0</code> and <code>name#0</code> cannot be equal? Or can, or will, they be equal if the context is identical?</li>
<li>The term “deterministic” does not appear anywhere else in the XDM spec, so one is inclined to think of the XQFO nondeterminism. It is then unclear whether two instances of, for example, <code>map:entries</code> and <code>fn:parse-xml</code> can be “the same” if the parameters are the same.</li>
<li>In XQFO 17.1.1, “must return the same function.” is also unclear: What exactly is meant by “same function”? Is it a function that creates an identical result (thus, excluding nondeterministic functions like <code>fn:parse-xml</code>)?</li>
<li>We should explain better what was the motivation to include the context-dependency of functions in the definition. It would certainly be more intuitive if both <code>deep-equal(name#0, name#0)</code> and <code>deep-equal(name#1, name#1)</code> returned <code>true</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m sorry for not offering good answers in return. I could try to describe what we’ve implemented so far – mostly inspired by the test cases – but I’m not sure if it meets the requirements.</p>

<p>consider</p>
<pre><code>      &lt;xsl:variable name="foo1"&gt;
         &lt;foo/&gt;
      &lt;/xsl:variable&gt;

</code></pre>
<p>question - what is the type of <code>foo1</code>?
answer - (according to my saxon/oxygen setup the answer is) "document-node"</p>
<p>consider</p>
<pre><code>      &lt;xsl:variable name="foo2" as="element(foo)"&gt;
         &lt;foo/&gt;
      &lt;/xsl:variable&gt;

</code></pre>
<p>question - is this code valid then (I would as someone not used to xslt 2+ assume not)?
answer - yes</p>
<p>but surely this code is identical to foo1, so the 'type' of variable is actually changing the interpretation of the expression.</p>
<p>For me that's quite confusing</p>
<p>It would appear that these 2 values are not two different views (interfaces) of the same underlying value, else this</p>
<p><code>     &lt;xsl:variable name="foo3" as="element(foo)" select="$foo1"/&gt;</code></p>
<p>would be valid.</p>
<p>It isnt (i.e. this doesn't appear to be some subtle OO style scenario where an evaluation can have multiple interfaces, here 'document-node' and 'element' are presumably disjoint types).</p>
<p>For me conceptually types are descriptions of expressions, they have no behaviour, yet here they appear to (to me) effect the interpretation, not simply describe it.</p>
<p>For me, I'd prefer a 'strict' mode where either</p>
<pre><code>      &lt;xsl:variable name="foo2" as="element(foo)"&gt;
         &lt;foo/&gt;
      &lt;/xsl:variable&gt;

</code></pre>
<p>is a type error, because the expression is clearly a document-node OR some other mechanism to clarify the ambiguity without this conceptual wrinkle.</p>
<p>An expression should either have 1 interpretation, or if its ambigious, that should be an error, I don't think the language should default to prefer one over another.</p>
<p>P.S.
why doesnt this work? I genuinely don't know how to explicitly declare something as a document-node.</p>
<pre><code>  &lt;xsl:variable name="foo1" as=document-node()&gt;
     &lt;foo/&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:variable&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>A consequence of this rule is that you can't have two documents in the same execution scope with the same document-uri() property.</p>
<p>Enforcing this rule causes a lot of trouble. For example at the API level, the user can set two stylesheet or query parameters to two different documents that are associated with the same URI. Another example, two XSLT packages in the same stylesheet can call doc() on the same URI and get different documents back because they have set different validation and whitespace-stripping options. Use of <code>fn:transform()</code> causes further complications when documents are passed across the boundary (in fact that's where we first encountered the problem). And <code>collection()</code> brings further complications.</p>
<p>In order to conform to the rule in the spec, we changed Saxon a while back so the only documents that are guaranteed to have a document-uri() property are those that were read using the doc() function - and even then, things like validation and whitespace variations are troublesome. This causes users much confusion, partly, because of the change from earlier Saxon releases, but more because there are many situations where they would expect document-uri() to give a useful result and it doesn't.</p>
<p>I think we can fix this simply by removing the guarantee. That will cause less inconvenience to users than the current rule. We could perhaps modify it to say that in the case of a document returned from the doc() function, its document-uri() property will be such that a call to doc() with that URI will return the same document, but in the case of documents derived from other sources (for example <code>collection()</code>, or a result from <code>fn:transform</code>) there is no such guarantee.</p>

<p>There are a number of situations in which error behaviour is insufficiently specified:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider the partial function application <code>fn:contains(?, 23)</code>, where the second argument is an integer, not a string. Does the partial application fail, or does it result in a function item that fails when dynamically evaluated? The spec does not say.</li>
<li>Consider the expression <code>function-lookup(fn:name, 0</code>) evaluated when there is no context item in the dynamic context. Does the call on function-lookup fail, or does it return a function item that fails when dynamically evaluated? The spec does not say, though there are numerous test cases in the function-lookup test set that suggest the latter.</li>
<li>The same is true for the expression <code>fn:name#0</code> evaluated when there is no context item in the dynamic context.</li>
<li>Consider a user-defined function <code>my:f</code> with a parameter that has a default value of "."; consider both a function reference <code>my:f#0</code> and a partial application <code>my:f(?)</code> evaluated when there is no context item. Again, I think the spec is unclear on the error behaviour.</li>
</ul>
<p>It feels to me that the right thing to do in all these cases is to raise the error early: that is, to fail at the point where a function item is being constructed, not at the point where the function item is subsequently evaluated. However, this disagrees with QT3 expected test results for tests such as <code>fn-function-lookup-267</code> and <code>function-literal-267</code>.</p>

<p>We should extend <code>fn:compare</code> to support arbitrary atomic types. The comparison rules…</p>

<li>would rely on the existing <code>op:</code> functions for the remaining types.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the rule for dates would be:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>0</code> is returned if <code>op:date-equal(A, B)</code> is <code>true</code>,</li>
<li><code>-1</code> is returned if <code>op:date-less-than(A, B)</code> is <code>true</code>,</li>
<li><code>1</code> is returned otherwise.</li>

<p>Some types will be rejected (<code>xs:duration</code>, <code>xs:QName</code>, <code>xs:NOTATION</code>, Gregorian types).</p>
<p>In addition, I would vote for making <code>fn:numeric-compare</code> and <code>fn:atomic-equal</code> private. I don’t see a benefit to expose them; I rather expect people to be confused.</p>

<p>Although we define it as "A named function reference is an expression (written name#arity) which evaluates to a [function item]", the term "named function reference" perpetuates the incorrect assumption that it is some kind of literal or constant denoting a function item.</p>
<p>Of course, in many cases it can be treated as just that. But not when the function is context-dependent, for example name#0 or lang#1.</p>
<p>The term is also questionable because one would assume that a "named function reference" is a reference to a "named function", but there is no such concept as a "named function".</p>
<p>So what might be a better name? What the expression actually does (when evaluated) is to search the static context for a function definition whose name and arity range correspond, and then construct a function item that captures the relevant part of the dynamic context in its closure. It's hard to encapsulate all of that in a simple name for the construct, but I would suggest <strong>named function generator</strong>. This is sufficiently close to the current term to be recognisable, but tries to capture the fact that it's not just a constant or literal, it's an expression that activately does something when evaluated; and it's reasonably accurate in that the result of the evaluation is a function item that has a non-absent name.</p>

<p>I don't propose to change the error code.</p>
<p>The only practical distinction is that this will allow the error to be reported statically when it can be detected statically, for example if the user writes something like</p>
<pre><code>function($x as node()) {
  starts-with(name(), 'x')
}
</code></pre>
<p>At present Saxon will give you a compile-time warning for this, followed by a run-time error if the code is actually executed; this is the required behaviour for dynamic errors.</p>
<p>The change does mean that in a case like this example, it will no longer be possible to catch the error using try/catch. However, type errors can only be reported statically if the code is bound to fail at run-time, and catching errors that occur every time is not especially useful.</p>

<p>I've been assuming, though I'm not sure we ever discussed it, that this automatically means that the two types can be "atomic equal" from the point of view of entries in maps: that is, a hexBinary representation of a particular binary value can no longer coexist in a map with a base64Binary representation of the same binary value.</p>
<p>If we were starting from scratch this would clearly make sense, but it has some messy implications:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's a backwards incompatibility; in 3.1 you could construct maps that you can no longer construct in 4.0</li>
<li>It potentially affects interoperability of 3.1 and 4.0 applications. For example, an XQuery 4.0 application invoking an XSLT 3.0 transformation via <code>fn:transform</code> might get back a map that's not a valid map in 4.0.</li>
</ul>
<p>In effect, this is not just a change to the behaviour of one function/operator, it is a data model change, because it changes the value space of the <code>map(*)</code> data type.</p>
<p>And more parochially, I freely admit, there's a lot of internal complexity trying to maintain a code base that supports both the 3.1 and 4.0 rules simultaneously.</p>
<p>Is this a feature that benefits users sufficiently to justify the transition complexities? Note that we can still support "eq" between the two data types without supporting <code>fn:atomic-equal</code>.</p>

<p>The proposal introduces a new fn:numeric-compare function that differs from lt/eq primarily in that decimals are compared retaining their full precision, rather than converting them to doubles which may lose precision. This makes the comparison fully transitive which makes it safe to use in all sorting algorithms.</p>
<p>The new comparison semantics are exploited in max(), min(), and sort(), and indirectly in highest() and lowest(); they are also referenced for comparing numeric values in XSLT <code>xsl:sort</code> (and therefore indirectly in <code>xsl:merge</code>) and in XQuery <code>order by</code>.</p>

<p>This is the spec that results. I feel it's a good trade-off; by adding three optional parameters to <code>fn:subsequence</code>, we can eliminate 4 functions that we are having trouble finding names for. The examples feel to me to be intuitive and readable; and there is more capability in the new function than we had before, for example by combining a predicate for the start position with an integer for the length.</p>
<p>I haven't explored arity-2 callbacks - these certainly need some notes and examples.</p>

<ul>
<li>In #843, we try to harmonize the function names across sequences, maps, and arrays. We have <code>array:get</code> and <code>map:get</code> to retrieve single entries of the input, but we have <code>fn:items-at</code> for sequences.</li>
<li><code>fn:items-at</code> allows you to supply more than a single position, but <code>items-at($seq, (1, 3, 2)</code> can easily be rewritten to <code>(1, 3, 2) ! get($seq, .)</code> – similar to <code>(1, 3, 2) ! array:get($array, .)</code> and <code>(1, 3, 2) ! map:get($map, .)</code>.</li>
<li>With #844, <code>fn:items-at</code> would be the only function left with <code>items</code> in its name.</li>
</ul>
<p>The function signature would be as simple as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">fn:get(
  $input  as item()*,
  $at     as xs:integer	
) as item()
</code></pre>
<p>Obviously, most people will still use <code>$input[$at]</code> – but the same applies to arrays and maps (and other functions like <code>fn:head</code>). One of the advantages of <code>fn:get</code> is that you can pass on the context item as position argument.</p>

Currently <code>fn:sort</code>, as well as XSLT and XQuery sorting, rely on the "lt" operator for comparing values including mixed numerics such as doubles and decimals. Because this promotes to double, it is capable of losing precision, and is therefore non-transitive. Most sort algorithms rely on the supplied comparison function being transitive, and if it isn't, then undefined failures may occur including non-termination.</p>
<p>One particular quirk (which led me here) is that <code>fn:highest</code> and <code>fn:lowest</code> start by using <code>fn:sort</code> semantics to put the values in order, and then rely on <code>fn:deep-equal</code> semantics to find the values that are "equal highest" or "equal lowest". But <code>fn:sort</code> and <code>fn:deep-equal</code> have different ways of deciding whether two values are equal: decimal 1.2 and double 1.2 are equal for <code>fn:sort</code>, but not for <code>fn:deep-equal</code>.</p>

My understanding of the situation is:</p>
<p>For <code>eq</code>, <code>=</code>, etc, we continue to use the XPath 2.0/3.0/3.1 rules for backwards compatibility reasons: for example comparison between decimal and double is done by converting the decimal to a double. This has known problems in terms of transitivity, but we have retained the rules because we identified that too many compatibility problems would be introduced by changing them.</p>
<p>For deep-equal, distinct-values, XSLT and XQuery grouping, etc, we have switched to the rules that were introduced for comparing map keys in 3.0, now available through the fn:atomic-equal function. Under these rules, doubles are promoted to decimals for comparison.</p>
<p>We should probably include a table showing which rules are used where.</p>
<p>A good example to use is (1e-3 = 0.001). This is true in both 3.1 and 4.0. But under the rules for maps in 3.1, and the new rules for distinct-values in 4.0, these two values are considered distinct.</p>

<p>The effect of the deep lookup expression E??KS is obtained by evaluating E, establishing its recursive content C, removing any item that is not a map or array to yield a sequence D, and then evaluating the shallow lookup expression D?KS, but with one exception: if evaluation of any shallow lookup fails, then the error is not propagated, but instead its result is taken to be an empty sequence.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>The definition of "recursive content" needs to be tightened up.</li>
<li>It needs to be more clearly stated which errors we ignore, and which we don't. For example, what if the key specifier evaluates to a non-singleton sequence?</li>
<li>In the case of <code>$E??*</code> in particular, I don't think it makes much sense to exclude items that are not maps or arrays. I think the expectation in this case is to return the full recursive content.</li>
<li>As currently defined, if <code>$M</code> is a map, the the result of <code>$M??*</code> includes the map <code>$M</code> itself. I don't think this matches expectations. Certainly, with the parallel expression <code>$node//*</code>, the result does not include <code>$node</code>.</li>

<p>If the context value is anything other than a single item, the semantics of the expression ?KS are defined to be equivalent to the expression . ! ?KS. The remainder of this section therefore explains the semantics on the assumption that the [context value] is a single item, referred to as the context item.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consider the case where the context value is a sequence of two maps <code>(map{'x':1, 1:'p', 2:'q'}, map{'x':2, 1:'P', 2:'Q'})</code> and the expression is <code>?(?x)</code>. What is the context for evaluation of the key specifier <code>(?x)</code>? I would have expected that we evaluate the key specifier once, in the outer context, so the key specifier value is <code>(1,2)</code> and we therefore take the entries with keys 1 and 2 in both maps, giving a result of ('p', 'q', 'P', 'Q'). But the cited paragraph suggests we evaluate KS separately for each item in the context value, and this return entry 1 of map 1 and entry 2 of map 2, giving a result of ('p', 'Q').</p>
<p>I know it's an edge case and it's unlikely in practice that people will write context-dependent key specifiers, but the rules need to be clear. I thought we had previously decided that the key specifier expression should be evaluated in the outer context.</p>

<p>The description of <code>build-uri</code> was written with the expectation that if a key was in the map, it's value should be used. I don't really want to replace every occurrence of</p>
<pre><code>if `x` is present in the map
</code></pre>
<p>with</p>
<pre><code>if `x` is present in the map and its value is not the empty sequence
</code></pre>
<p>So I've attempted to justify that globally with the following paragraph at the beginning of the description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The components are derived from the contents of the $parts map. To simplify the description below, any key whose value is the empty sequence is ignored; this is equivalent to the key not being present in the map.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not hugely proud of that bit of prose though. Suggestions for improvements most welcome.</p>

<p>A. What about renaming <code>fn:contains-sequence</code>, <code>fn:starts-with-sequence</code> and <code>fn:ends-with-sequence</code> to <code>fn:contains-items</code>, <code>fn:starts-with-items</code> and <code>fn:ends-with-items</code>, in alignment with <code>fn:items-at</code>, <code>fn:items-before</code>, etc.? If we add equivalent functions for arrays, it could be <code>array:contains-members</code>, etc.</p>
<p>B. It seems confusing to have <code>fn:items-starting-where</code> and <code>fn:items-after</code>, instead of <code>fn:items-starting-after</code>. Maybe we can think of alternative (shorter) names for <code>fn:items-starting-where</code> and <code>fn:items-ending-where</code>? – I know we’ve discussed before; I raised it again due to user feedback.</p>

<p>Per discussion on the list, this PR changes the way <code>git</code> handles line endings so that text files will always, exclusively have line endings delimited by a single <code>lf</code>. This should be a largely transparent change for Mac/Unix users. On Windows, it means that checked out files will have <code>lf</code> line termination. If your favorite editing tool can handle this, then you don't have to care. Even if your editor saves files with <code>cr</code>/<code>lf</code> line endings, <code>git</code> will turn them back into single <code>lf</code> endings when you commit your changes.</p>
<p>Hat tip to @ChristianGruen for keeping focus on this issue.</p>
<p>This PR has no technical changes, and effects a relatively small number of files. I'll leave it here for a day or two, then I'm going to be inclined to merge it. Object now, if you object :-)</p>

Today, we have numerous other data types apart from strings, doubles, booleans, and nodes, and I believe it’s time to do justice to this by getting rid of the error for unsupported data types for <code>fn:boolean</code>.</p>
<p>We currently have:</p>
<p>Type | Rule to compute boolean value
--- | ---
<code>node()</code> | <code>true()</code>
<code>xs:boolean</code> | <code>$item != 0 and not(is-NaN($item))</code>
<code>xs:untypedAtomic</code>, <code>xs:string</code>, <code>xs:anyURI</code> | <code>$item != ''</code></p>
<p>I have two options in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>The easiest solution, which would come closest to JavaScript, would be to return <code>true()</code> for all other items. This would allow us to do simple checks like:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">declare function local:byte-length($data as xs:basexBinary?) xs:integer {
  (: instead of exists($data); utilizes the EXPath Binary Module :)
  if($data) then bin:length($data) else 0
};
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>If we want to be more fine granular, we could do justice to the specifics of 4 more types:</li>
</ol>
<p>Type | Rule to compute boolean value
--- | ---
<code>array(*)</code> | <code>array:size($item) != 0</code>
<code>map(*)</code> | <code>map:size($item) != 0</code>
<code>xs:base64Binary</code><br><code>xs:hex64Binary</code> | <code>bin:length($item) != 0</code> or <br><code>not($item = (xs:hexBinary(''), xs:base64Binary(''))</code></p>
<p>It would then be possible to write:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>if($map)</code> instead of <code>map:size($map) != 0</code> or <code>map:exists($map)</code> (see <a href="https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/827">#827</a> for the naming controversy).<br>Note that <code>if($map)</code> will also return <code>false()</code> is <code>$map</code> is an empty sequence.</li>
<li><code>if($func) { $func(1, 2) }</code> instead of <code>exists($func)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>In the last comments of #817, it was addressed that the behavior of existing code may change if errors are replaced by results. I hope we can live with that, as I cannot think of cases in which the EBV computation make sense for items that always raise an error.</p>
<p>Which option do some of you prefer?</p>

<div class="toot" id="created-826"><h2>Issue #826 created<span class="toot-id"> #created-826</span></h2><div class="pubdate">09 Nov at 14:03:11 GMT</div><div class="link">Link: <a href="https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/826">https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/826</a></div><details><summary>Arrays: Representation of single members of an array</summary><div class="markup"><p>When introducing the new array features to some users, the <code>for member</code> syntax was welcomed by everyone.</p>
<p>However, there was some confusion (again, see my past <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-xslt-40/2023Jun/0026.html">feedback to the mailing list</a>) about what the QT4 group considers to be “members of an array”, and about value records.</p>
<p>In particular, the “value record” representation of arrays led to questions that I didn’t have a good answer for. In particular, people didn’t understand why an array member was returned as a map, and why that map is (again) called “array member” or “value record” – a term no one associated with arrays (at least for now… which somewhat is not surprising, as it has just been introduced).</p>
<p>Next, due to atomization (as mentioned before), <code>array:split</code> allows us to omit the explicit <code>?value</code> lookups that are required for <code>array:members</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">sum(array:members($array)?value)
sum(array:split($array))
</code></pre>
<p>I suppose I have been biased in my presentation, but I’ve failed to give good arguments to justify the current solution in the spec. The questions that I think need to be answered are:</p>
<ul>
<li>How will people benefit from the (usually intermediate) map representation for array members?</li>
<li>What exactly do we win with <code>array:members</code> and <code>array:of-members</code> instead of using the existing <code>array:join</code> function, combined with the new <code>array:split</code> function?</li>
</ul>
<p>Out of interest, I have rewritten the formal equivalencies for the array functions with <code>array:split</code>/<code>array:join</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>array:append</code></li>
</ul>
<p><code>array:of-members((array:members($array), map{'value':$member}))</code>
<code>array:join((array:split($array), array { $member }))</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code>array:build</code></li>
</ul>
<p><code>array:of-members($input ! map { 'value': $action(.) })</code>
<code>array:join($input ! array { $action(.) })</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code>array:filter</code></li>
</ul>
<p><code>array:of-members(array:members($array) =&gt; filter(function($m) { $predicate($m?value) })</code>
<code>array:join(array:split($array) =&gt; filter(function($m) { $predicate($m?*) })</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code>array:for-each</code></li>
</ul>
<p><code>array:of-members(array:members($array) ! map { 'value': $action(?value) })</code>
<code>array:join(array:split($array) ! array { $action(?*) })</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code>array:for-each-pair</code></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>array:of-members(
  for-each-pair(array:members($array1), 
    array:members($array2), 
    function($m, $n) {map{'value': $action($m?value, $n?value)}}))
array:join(
  for-each-pair(array:split($array1), array:split($array2),
    function($m, $n) { array { $action($m?*, $n?*) } }))
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>array:insert-before</code></li>
</ul>
<p><code>array:of-members(array:members($array) =&gt; insert-before($position, map{'value':$member}))</code>
<code>array:join(array:split($array) =&gt; insert-before($position, array { $member }))</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code>array:remove</code></li>
</ul>
<p><code>array:of-members(array:members($array) =&gt; remove($positions))</code>
<code>array:join(array:split($array) =&gt; remove($positions))</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code>array:reverse</code></li>
</ul>
<p><code>array:of-members(array:members($array) =&gt; reverse())</code>
<code>array:join(array:split($array) =&gt; reverse())</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code>array:slice</code></li>
</ul>
<p><code>array:of-members(array:members($array) =&gt; slice($start, $end, $step))</code>
<code>array:join(array:split($array) =&gt; slice($start, $end, $step))</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code>array:split</code></li>
</ul>
<p><code>array:of-members(array:members($array) =&gt; sort($collation, function($x) { $key($x?value) }))</code>
<code>array:join(array:split($array) =&gt; sort($collation, function($x) { $key($x?*) }))</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code>array:subarray</code></li>
</ul>
<p><code>array:of-members(array:members($array) =&gt; subsequence($start, $length))</code>
<code>array:join(array:split($array) =&gt; subsequence($start, $length))</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code>array { $sequence }</code></li>
</ul>
<p><code>array:of-members($sequence ! map { 'value': . })</code>
<code>array:join($sequence ! array { . })</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code>[E1, E2, E3, ..., En]</code></li>
</ul>
<p><code>array:join((map { 'value': E1 }, map { 'value': E2 }, map { 'value': E3 }, ... map { 'value': En }))</code>
<code>array:join((array { E1 }, array { E2 }, array { E3 }, ... array { En }))</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code>$array?*</code></li>
</ul>
<p><code>array:members($array) ! ?value</code>
<code>array:split($array) ! ?*</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code>$array?$N / $array($N)</code></li>
</ul>
<p><code>array:members($array)[$N]?value</code>
<code>array:split($array)[$N]?*</code>  (or <code>array:get($array, $N)</code>)</p>
<hr>
<p>As a side note, I noticed that the equivalence given for <code>array:join</code> must be buggy:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">(: current equivalence presented in the spec :)
array:of-members($arrays ! array:members(.))

(: returns [ 1, 2, 3 ] :)
let $arrays := ([ 1 ], [ 2, 3 ])
return array:of-members($arrays ! array:members(.))
</code></pre>
<p>Concluding, If I could choose, I would tend to drop <code>array:members</code> and <code>array:of-members</code> and rename <code>array:split</code> to <code>array:members</code>.</p>

The reason is that I never learned to fully like them. It seems obvious where the rules come from, and why they have been reasonable in previous versions of the language. From today’s perspective, I think there’s really some need to simplify and unify the rules, and I believe it’s possible with little effort and without endangering backward compatibility (provided that we are willing to drop errors and return results).</p>
<p>Some examples for the somewhat strange nature of the current rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>boolean((&lt;_&gt;x&lt;/_&gt;, &lt;_&gt;y&lt;/_&gt;))</code> returns <code>true</code>, whereas <code>boolean(('x', 'y'))</code> raises an error.</li>
<li><code>boolean(xs:NCName('x'))</code> returns <code>true</code>, whereas <code>boolean(xs:QName('x'))</code> raises an error.</li>
<li><code>boolean((&lt;a/&gt;, 1))</code> and <code>boolean((1, &lt;a/&gt;))</code> may either return <code>true</code> or raise an error, depending on the implementation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe it will make much more sense to</p>
<ol>
<li>check all values of the input equally (in analogy to the existential semantics of general comparisons), and</li>
<li>use existence checks for more types instead of raising a clueless error.</li>
</ol>
<p>The semantics would be tidied up a lot, it could look like this…</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">declare function ebv($input as item()*) as xs:boolean {
  some $item in $input satisfies typeswitch($item) {
    case xs:untypedAtomic | xs:string | xs:anyURI  return $item != ''
    case xs:numeric                                return $item != 0
    case xs:boolean                                return $item
    default                                        return true()
  }
};
</code></pre>
<p>…or, if we include more types, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">declare function ebv($input as item()*) as xs:boolean {
  some $item in $input satisfies typeswitch($item) {
    case xs:untypedAtomic | xs:string | xs:anyURI  return $item != ''
    case xs:numeric                                return $item != 0
    case xs:boolean                                return $item
    case xs:base64Binary                           return $item != xs:base64Binary('')
    case xs:hexBinary                              return $item != xs:hexBinary('')
    case array(*)                                  return array:size($item) != 0
    case map(*)                                    return map:size($item) != 0
    default                                        return true()
  }
};
</code></pre>
<p>(If we believe that it’s too progressive to accept all types, we could still raise an error for some specific types… although I don’t think that anyone would benefit from this choice).</p>
<p>As a result, EBV checks could also be used to check more than one item:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">(: true if at least one tokenized string is non-empty :)
if(tokenize('a/', '/')) then ...
(: true if at least one number is unequal to 0 :)
if($numbers) then ...
(: true if at least one Boolean is true :)
if(false(), true(), true()) then ...
</code></pre>
<p>Nothing would change for the classical EBV checks: <code>if($node/*)</code>, <code>if($x = $y)</code>, <code>if($ok)</code>, …</p>
<p>Regarding “1. check all values of the input equally”, one could argue that this might affect performance. I don’t actually think so: For node sequences, it will still be sufficient to retrieve only the first item. For mixed-type sequences, errors were raised in the past.</p>
<p>The resulting EBV could be easily combined with revised predicate semantics (#816).</p>

<p>It would be handy to allow <code>E[1, 2, 3]</code> (<code>E[3, 2, 1]</code>, <code>E[1 to 3]</code>, etc.) as a shortcut for <code>E[position() = (1, 2, 3)]</code> (MarkLogic offers this possibility, if I remember correctly). We shouldn’t change the EBV syntax, and we should continue raising an error  if the predicate sequence contains items other than numbers. Examples:</p>
<p>Expression | Result
--- | ---
<code>(1 to 5)[2, 3]</code> | <code>2, 3</code>
<code>(1 to 5)[3, 2]</code> | <code>2, 3</code>
<code>(1 to 5)[2 to 3]</code> | <code>2, 3</code>
<code>(1 to 5)[6, 'x']</code> | <em>error</em>
<code>(1 to 5)[1 to 5, 'x']</code> | <code>1, 2, 3, 4, 5</code> or <em>error</em> (up to the implementation, similar to sequences that start with a node)</p>
<p>I bet this has already been discussed in the past…</p>

<ol>
<li>The regular expressions used to parse the fragment identifier and query are incorrect. The URI specification allows <code>?</code> to appear in a query string and <code>#</code> to appear in a fragment identifier, so the expressions have been rewritten to match everything after the first <code>?</code> and <code>#</code>, respectively, even if they contain additional <code>?</code> or <code>#</code> characters.</li>

<ul>
<li><code>hierarchical</code> option appears in the rules of the function but not its preamble</li>
<li>"This function is described..." moved to anticipate the actual narrative.</li>
<li>I was a bit thrown by the phrase "This approach...is not implementation advice" because "approach" is vague and the reader is left with the impression that a good deal of <em>something</em> that follows is non-normative. We offer non-normative prose in the rules, but that informal prose is normally followed by an equivalent description that <em>is</em> normative. I did not make any edits in this area, but I would recommend clarification as to exactly what parts of the narrative are normative and which are non-normative.</li>
<li>The period-to-colon change at 27573 is to make sure the reader remains aware of the governing "If..." clause.</li>
<li>I deleted a paragraph that attempted to distill the rather complicated description of <code>fn:decode-from-uri</code>. A mere xref provides a cleaner narrative here and a more accurate description of uri decoding, and the xref is within the same document, so should not pose a burden on the reader.</li>
<li>For the <code>query-parameters</code> there was a discrepancy in the data model presented (in the preamble versus in the function rules), and I opted for the array-of-maps model. If it's supposed to be the other way (simple map), let me know and I'll revise.</li>
<li><code>query-segments</code> versus <code>query-parameters</code>; I went with the latter.</li>

<p>Let me know where things ain't right.</p>

This phrase is defined to be a synonym of "value" or "sequence", and it seems to add a lot of words without adding any clarity. In many cases the context makes clear that it is actually referring to a tree rooted at a document node.</p>
<p>In section 3.1 "Setting Serialization Parameters by Means of a Data Model Instance" it would be helpful to use a more specific phrase, for example "a parameter document".</p>
<p>Elsewhere the phrase is often used to mean "the value being serialized", and again, it would be helpful to use a more specific phrase, perhaps a term that is quite distinctive such as "the payload". (It's sometimes referred to as "the result tree", but that assumes that the value being serialized is the result of a query or stylesheet.)</p>

It will create a new function item that differs from the original only in its annotations.</p>
<p>Currently annotations are a dynamic property of function items, but they can only be set in very limited ways. Allowing them to be set dynamically creates lot of opportunities. For example, there is currently no way to set annotations on a map or array, but one could define annotations, for example, to indicate that a map should hold entries ordered by key, or that an array should use a "sparse" implementation; there is scope both for spec-defined and vendor-defined (and perhaps even user-defined) annotations.</p>
<p>Some of the possibilities this would open up have been outlined in other issues. At present, though, we have a capability in the data model that is underexploited, and an <code>fn:annotate()</code> function is a conceptually simple addition, which can be justified purely on the grounds of completeness - if something exists in the data model, surely it should have getters and setters?</p>

The goal is to give XPath users access to CRC, checksum, and cryptographic hash functions.</p>
<h3>Rationale</h3>
<p>Simple checksums functions, such as those from the Fletcher family, are relatively easy to write in a host language such as XSLT. More complex ones are far more challenging to write, and may incur serious performance penalties. For example, from the TAN function library, see the <a href="https://github.com/textalign/TAN-2021/blob/master/functions/checksums/TAN-fn-hash-and-check.xsl">MD5 checksum/hash functions</a>. (Yes, one day I thought it would be fun to try to implement the MD5 algorithm in XSLT.) Most programming languages in which an implementation is written have access to cryptographic libraries that are highly performative.</p>
<p>Hash functions are widely used, and certainly important in XML-based workflows, whether as filenames, database fields, etc.</p>
<p>The closest comparable existing functions is <code>generate-id()</code>, but this was designed as an identifier for nodes.</p>
<p>In short, I believe there is a significant need that outstrips current functionality.</p>
<p>In the draft below, I have adopted only the MD-5 algorithm as a core requirement, to catalyze discussion. I have assumed the user wants the string form of the output, not the raw bits. I have not tried to flesh out prose that would warn users away from security complacency.</p>
<p>For discussion, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hash_functions">here is a list of relevant algorithms</a>. I look forward to community feedback.</p>
<h3><code>fn:hash</code> Draft Specification</h3>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>This function takes as input a string or octet sequence and returns a string representation of the results from a specified hash, checksum, or cyclic redundancy check function.</p>
<h4>Signature</h4>
<pre><code>fn:hash(
   $value as union(xs:string, xs:hexBinary, 
                   xs:base64Binary)?   := fn:string(.),
   $algorithm as xs:string             := "md5"
) as xs:string?
</code></pre>
<h4>Properties</h4>
<p>The zero-argument form of this function is deterministic, context-dependent, and focus-dependent.</p>
<p>The one- and two-argument form of this function is deterministic, context-independent, and focus-independent.</p>
<h4>Rules</h4>
<p>If the zero-argument version of the function is used, the result is the same as calling the one-argument version, with <code>$value</code> set to <code>fn:string(.)</code>.</p>
<p>If the one-argument version of the function is used, the result is the same as calling the two-argument version, with <code>$algorithm</code> set to "md5".</p>
<p>The effective value of <code>$algorithm</code> is the value of the expression <code>fn:lower-case(fn:replace($function, '\W+', ''))</code>.</p>
<p>If <code>$value</code> is the empty sequence, or a string of zero length, the function returns the empty sequence.</p>
<p>If <code>$value</code> is an instance of <code>xs:string</code> it is cast to <code>xs:hexBinary</code> on the basis of UTF-8 encoding. If <code>$value</code> is an instance of <code>xs:base64Binary</code> it is cast to <code>xs:hexBinary</code>.</p>
<p>The function returns an <code>xs:string</code> representation of the bytes returned by passing the <code>xs:hexBinary</code> value of <code>$value</code> as an octet sequence through the specified hash or checksum function.</p>
<p>Conforming implementations MUST support <code>md5</code> and the associated MD5 Message-Digest algorithm defined by RFC 6151 (update to RFC 1321). They MAY support other checksum and hash functions with implementation-defined semantics.</p>
<h4>Error Conditions</h4>
<p>A dynamic error is raised <em>[err:XXXXXXX]</em> if the effective value of <code>$algorithm</code> is not one of the values supported by the implementation.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>The MD5 algorithm is normally not used for cryptographic purposes. <em>[More cautionary prose about not assuming that something can be trusted as secure.]</em></li>
</ul>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>Expression | Result
-- | --
fn:hash("abc") | 900150983cd24fb0d6963f7d28e17f72
fn:hash("ABC") | 902fbdd2b1df0c4f70b4a5d23525e932</p>

I'm making it a distinct issue to call it out and see if we can get consensus on the right answer. I've come to the conclusion that what I've implemented isn't justified by any specific reading of the relevant specifications, so it's wrong.)</p>
<p>This question is slightly tricky because encoding (or not encoding) characters can change the meaning of the URI.</p>
<p>If you trace your way through the ABNF in RFC 3986 you eventually get to:</p>
<pre><code>   path-abempty  = *( "/" segment )
   path-absolute = "/" [ segment-nz *( "/" segment ) ]
   path-noscheme = segment-nz-nc *( "/" segment )
   path-rootless = segment-nz *( "/" segment )
   path-empty    = 0&lt;pchar&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The various <code>segment</code> nonterminals boil down to some number of <code>pchar</code>. (The <code>segment-nz</code> form is used to forbid a zero length string before the first <code>/</code>; the <code>segment-nz-nc</code> form is used for a URI that does not begin with a scheme: it must have a non-zero length string before the first <code>/</code> that additionally must not contain a <code>:</code>.)</p>
<pre><code>  pchar         = unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims / ":" / "@"
</code></pre>
<p>Where:</p>
<pre><code>  unreserved    = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~"
  pct-encoded   = "%" HEXDIG HEXDIG
  sub-delims    = "!" / "$" / "&amp;" / "'" / "(" / ")" / "*" / "+" / "," / ";" / "="
</code></pre>
<p>I think it follows that all characters <strong>except</strong> the following must be encoded:</p>
<p>Upper-and lower-case <code>A</code> to <code>Z</code>, the digits <code>0</code> to <code>9</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>.</code>, <code>_</code>, <code>~</code>, <code>%</code>, <code>!</code>, <code>$</code>, <code>&amp;</code>, <code>'</code>, <code>(</code>, <code>)</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>+</code>, <code>,</code>, <code>;</code>, <code>=</code>, <code>:</code>, and <code>@</code>.</p>
<p>or, conversely, that any characters <em>other than those</em> <strong>must</strong> be encoded.</p>
<p>Observe that <code>/</code> isn't among the characters that are not encoded. That's because the <code>/</code> in hierarchical URIs divides the segments. It's part of the URI syntax. That's <em>why</em> a literal forward slash that appears somewhere in an actual path segment must be encoded <code>%2F</code> and it's why causually unencoding such a character changes the URI.</p>
<p>Observe also that there's no provision here for encoding a space with <code>+</code>, even though it's fairly common. I've carried that error through to some of the test results for <code>fn:build-uri</code> and <code>fn:parse-uri</code>. I'll fix those tests.</p>
<p>I'm going to try changing my implementation to follow the rule above and see what happens.</p>
<p>If you think this analysis is incorrect, please explain where I went wrong.</p>

But is it useful? It means we're producing XML that isn't valid according to the SVG schema, and that presumably might be rejected by tools that expect to handle valid SVG.</p>
<p>In passing, I note that it's very hard to work out from the parse-html() spec what the function actually does; it's somehow written as if it's obvious, but it never gets around to actually saying it explicitly. It also doesn't say what happens when the <code>method</code> option is omitted, as it is in these tests.</p>
<p>In addition, it seems that we don't have any tests that exercise the various options of the function, e.g. the ability to consue binary as well as character input.</p>

Although the term is qualified in the diagnostic functions with the adjective "trace" or "log", it's tempting to think of the function's actual output. Coming back a few weeks later, I think some gentle massaging (instead of a convoluted preamble) can help readers not make the requisite adjustment, reflected in the present PR.</p>

<p>The function now computes the set of nodes delivered by the transitive closure of the supplied <code>$step</code> function when applied to a given <code>$start</code> node, rather than returning a function item that must then be applied to the chosen $start node. This is hopefully easier for most users to understand, and does not lose any useful functionality.</p>
<p>The <code>$min</code> parameter of the old function is effectively forced to its default value of 1, and the $max value to its default of infinity.</p>

Fix #554</p>
<p>This PR addresses the main points of #554 in making the function correspond more closely to the mathematical (or at least the computer-science) definition of transitive closure. It doesn't implement other ideas in #554, like returning the depth of search alongside the actual closure. That's because I believe in the principle that wherever possible a function should do one thing in as simple a way as possible.</p>

<p>Format| Serialize Function | Parse Function
--- | --- | ---
<strong>XML</strong> | <code>fn:serialize($input)</code> | <code>fn:parse-xml</code>
<strong>JSON</strong> | <code>fn:serialize($input, map { 'method': 'json' })</code> | <code>fn:parse-json</code>

<strong>HTML</strong> | <code>fn:serialize($input, map { 'method': 'html' })</code> | <code>fn:parse-html</code>
<strong>CSV</strong> | <em>still missing</em> | <code>fn:parse-csv</code> and variants</p>
<p>In BaseX, the XML created by <code>fn:json-to-xml</code> can be serialized back to JSON as follows (related: #759):</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">serialize(
  &lt;map xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions"&gt;

<p>If we want to be able to use output options in the XQuery prolog, we additionally need to define a syntax for serializing the options to a single string:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">declare namespace output = 'http://www.w3.org/2010/xslt-xquery-serialization';
declare option output:method 'json';
declare option output:json 'escape-solidus=yes,number-format=#';
map { "abc": 123 }

<p>Both suggestions are inspired by our own implementation; we use it for our custom JSON and CSV options.</p>

<p>I propose the following:</p>

<p>I think we would all agree that multiple simple functions would be the better choice except for the problem that they all end up going into a single global namespace. So the question becomes, how can we better partition the name-space (using the term deliberately with a hyphen).</p>
<p>We're reluctant to use the namespace mechanism to partition our function library because namespaces are cumbersome and clutter the code with lots of boilerplate; declaring namespaces for binding function libraries also has side-effects for example on the semantics of element constructors.</p>
<p>One approach would be to build on the idea that @dnovatchev presented of using maps containing anonymous functions, so for example <code>csv()?parse()</code> would first call fn:csv() to load a family (or library) of functions, of which one is then selected for execution. This works, but I don't think it's a perfect solution; for example static analysis becomes a lot more difficult, and we don't get the benefits of default parameters and keyword arguments.</p>
<p>Most languages use hierarchic names with "." as a separator. Although XML names allow "." as a regular character, none of our built-in function names currently use it as such. So it would be entirely possible to adopt a convention where names like csv.parse() etc are used to name functions in a function family referred to as "csv". This wouldn't by itself require any language changes.</p>
<p>But if we adopted this convention, we could build on it to provide usability tweaks that make a large function library easier to manage. For example, we could put the math functions into the fn namespace with names like <code>fn:math.sin(x)</code>, and then provide a way of binding a namespace prefix to a subtree of the fn namespace, so math:sin becomes a synonym for fn:math.sin(). The immediate benefit is that the namespace prefix doesn't need to be declared unless people want to use it. We could also then consider defining an algorithm for searching the fn namespace for abbreviated names such as sin(x), perhaps with some form of "import functions" declaration that says which subtrees of the fn namespace are to be searched.</p>

<hr>
<p>We have no expression yet to bind a value to the context value. Such an expression would be useful, among other things, to extend the focus function to sequences (<code>fn { . }</code>, see #129).</p>
<p>Here are 3 possible constructs for that, ordered by my personal preference:</p>
<h3>1. Value Map Expression</h3>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">ValueExpr      ::=  ValidateExpr | ExtensionExpr | ValueMapExpr
ValueMapExpr   ::=  SimpleMapExpr ("~" SimpleMapExpr)*
SimpleMapExpr  ::=  PathExpr ("!" PathExpr)*

(: Example :)
//flower ~ (count(.) || ' flowers: ' || string-join(name, ', '))
</code></pre>
<p>The expression would be similar to the simple map expression (which we could rename to item map expression). The following equivalents would then exist for simple FLWOR expressions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">for $i in (1 to 5) return string($i)  ≍  (1 to 5) ! string(.)
let $i := (1 to 5) return count($i)   ≍  (1 to 5) ~ count(.)
</code></pre>
<p><code>fn { E }</code> could be rewritten to <code>fn($c) { $c ~ E }</code>.</p>
<h3>2. Context Value Declaration</h3>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">ContextExpr  ::=  "context" "{" Expr "}" EnclosedExpr

(: Example :)
context { //flower } {
  count(.) || ' flowers: ' || string-join(name, ', ')
}
</code></pre>
<p>The result of the first expression defines the context value, the second expression can reference the context.</p>
<p><code>fn { E }</code> could be rewritten to <code>fn($c) { context { $c } { E } }</code>.</p>
<h3>3. Enhanced FLWOR expression (for the sake of completion)</h3>
<p>Similar to variables, the dot could be used to bind and reference the context:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">LetBinding  ::=  ("." | ("$" VarName)) TypeDeclaration? ":=" ExprSingle
ForBinding  ::=  ("." | ("$" VarName)) TypeDeclaration? AllowingEmpty? PositionalVar? "in" ExprSingle

(: Example :)
let . := //flower
return count(.) || ' flowers: ' || string-join(name, ', ')
</code></pre>
<p><code>fn { E }</code> could be rewritten to <code>fn($c) { let . := $c return E }</code>.</p>
<h3>Assessment</h3>
<ul>
<li>The first solution looks most appealing to me. I like the analogy with the existing syntax for single items.</li>
<li>We could choose the second solution if we believe that the expression will be rarely used.</li>
<li>I‘ve backed away from the third solution; I think it would be too pervasive.</li>
</ul>

  $min   as xs:nonNegativeInteger?       := 1,
  $max   as xs:positiveInteger?          := ()

<div class="toot" id="created-750"><h2>Issue #750 created<span class="toot-id"> #created-750</span></h2><div class="pubdate">15 Oct at 22:56:41 GMT</div><div class="link">Link: <a href="https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/750">https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/750</a></div><details><summary>xsl:mode/@as and built-in template rules</summary><div class="markup"><p>See ACTION QT4CG-048-01</p>
<p>The question arose, if an xsl:mode declaration specifies an expected type in @as, then all template rules in that mode are expected/required to deliver a value conforming to that type. But what about the default/fallback template rules? Surely they need to deliver a value of that type as well?</p>
<p>For example, suppose the mode specifies as="xs:boolean". Regardless of the value of <code>xsl:on-no-match</code>, none of the built-in template rules is going to deliver a boolean. You're expecting a boolean result from xsl:apply-templates, and if none of the template rules match, you're going to get something other than a boolean.</p>
<p>I think the answer is to say that you get a type error if the built-in template rule for the mode returns a value that's not of the required type.</p>
<p>I don't think this error should ever be reported statically, because the compiler has no way of knowing whether the set of explicit template rules is sufficient to cover all cases that will actually arise in source documents.</p>

<p>The functions for parsing input have been defined by different people, and the current state is quite inconsistent:</p>
<p>Function | Parameters
--- | ---
<code>fn:parse-xml</code> | <code>$value as xs:string?, $options as map(*)?</code>
<code>fn:doc</code> | <code>$source as xs:string?</code>
<code>fn:parse-json</code> | <code>$value as xs:string?, $options as map(*)?</code>
<code>fn:json-doc</code> | <code>$source as xs:string?, $options as map(*)?</code>
<code>fn:parse-html</code> | <code>$html as (xs:string \| xs:hexBinary \| xs:base64Binary)?, $options as map(*)?</code>
<code>fn:parse-csv</code> | <code>$csv as xs:string?, $options as map(*)?</code></p>
<p>I believe there’s some need to unify the functions. We should:</p>
<ul>
<li>add <code>fn:csv-doc($source, $options)</code> and <code>fn:html-doc($source, $options)</code>,</li>
<li>rename the argument of all <code>fn:parse-...</code> functions to <code>$value</code>,</li>
<li>enhance all <code>fn:parse-...</code> functions to also accept binaries, and</li>
<li>always return an empty sequence if the source/input argument is empty.</li>
</ul>
<p>See #1021 for <code>fn:doc</code>.</p>

<p>The subtyping rules (newly defined in terms of unions of singleton enumeration sets) seem to work in their current form, without change. <code>enum("red", "green")</code> is still a subtype of <code>xs:string</code>, because all the enumerated values are instances of <code>xs:string</code>.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Lexical substitution has little, if anything at all, to do with (dynamic) loading. Nothing is loaded from some external resource, as in the case of <strong><code>fn: load-xquery-module</code></strong> and <strong><code>fn:transform</code></strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is nothing dynamic about having a predefined function that has a predefined set of possible values. In fact this could be defined as a strictly/statically defined <strong><code>map(xs:string, function(item()*, item()*) as item()*)</code></strong> with all allowed possible keys and as their values - the corresponding functions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Taking this into account it is suggested to move <code>fn:op</code> to a section where it truly belongs. Maybe have in this section also other features of the language that are merely lexical substitution, as for example, function(s) for the creation of type-aliases.</p>

<p>At present this can be achieved by declaring a local variable bound to an anonymous function, but it's clumsy to have to use completely different syntax for local and global functions, and functions defined in this way cannot be mutually recursive.</p>
<p>I propose that such functions should shadow any global functions with the same name, in the same way as happens with local variable declarations. I have an open mind as to whether shadowing of functions in reserved namespaces should be allowed.</p>
<p>The main difficulty is the scoping rules. We don't want the problems Javascript has with "hoisting". I propose that (a) all local function declarations must appear before any instructions (or local variable declarations, but not params) within the sequence constructor, and (b) these function declarations are in-scope throughout the sequence constructor including forwards references from the body of other functions declared earlier within the same sequence constructor.</p>

At present XQuery says nothing, and XSLT says very little.</p>
<p>XQuery 3.1 says: <em>A validate expression can be used to validate a document node or an element node with respect to the [in-scope schema definitions], using the schema validation process defined in [[XML Schema 1.0]] or [[XML Schema 1.1]].</em> This doesn't really answer the question. The "with respect to" phrase could be read as implying that ONLY the in-scope schema definitions are used. Particular problems occur if xsi:schemaLocation refers to a schema document that attempts to override or redefine the schema components that have been statically imported.</p>
<p>XSLT 3.0 says nothing of interest about what schema (=set of schema components) is used when validation is requested, though it does mention in passing that <code>xsi:schemaLocation</code> attributes might be interpreted in some way by a schema processor.</p>
<p>If we look to the behaviour of Saxon as a reference implementation, then we'll quickly find fault. There's a configuration option to control whether <code>xsi:schemaLocation</code> attributes are considered or ignored; if they are considered, then the schema components referenced are added to a global pool of schema components which are used not only to validate the document in question, but to validate any subsequent documents. We're in the process of redesigning this to do something that makes more sense.</p>

<p>The problem is that it's not possible, within the XPath/XQuery language, to implement such a function with implicit access to the object on which it is invoked. The implementation of the function does not have access to any kind of <code>$this</code> variable.</p>
<p>This issue considers how we can move forwards from supporting simple records to introduce object capabilities, in an incremental and compatible way.</p>
<p>Here are three steps in that direction:</p>
<ol>
<li>Where a named record type is declared, also create a corresponding constructor function. So if you declare</li>
</ol>
<p><code>declare item type my:loc as record(longitude as xs:double, latitude as xs:double)</code></p>
<p>you also get a constructor function allowing my:loc(180, 180), allowing both positional or keyword arguments corresponding to the field names,</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Allow default values to be defined in the record type, which act as default values for the parameters in the constructor function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow functions that are defined as part of a record type access to a variable $this. The constructor function provides an implicit binding of this variable to the record/map/object that is being instantiated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow self-reference to a named record type (and its constructor function) within the record definition.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So you can now do:</p>
<pre><code>declare type my:counter as record (
   value as xs:integer,
   increment := fn() as my:counter {my:counter($this?value + 1)}
)
</code></pre>
<p>and then</p>
<pre><code>let $x := my:counter(0)
return $x?increment()?value
</code></pre>
<p>which returns 1.</p>

<p>The current draft uses the type <code>map(xs:integer, xs:string)</code> for the <code>column-names</code> option to <code>fn:csv-to-xdm</code> and <code>fn:csv-to-xml</code>. This PR flips that to <code>map(xs:string, xs:integer)</code>. It turns out that the examples were already using this, and it seems to me that having the <code>names</code> entry in the <code>csv-columns-record</code> record type be the transposed version of the <code>column-names</code> option that creates it, rather than be the same thing, is counterproductive.</p>
<p>I can think of some examples (a CSV split into several chunks, with only the first containing the headers) where being able to feed the <code>names</code> entry right back into another invocation of <code>fn:csv-to-xdm</code> would be useful. If nothing else it's confusing and not obvious, or I wouldn't have messed up the examples, and somebody would have noticed during the review process...</p>

<p>Generators are well known and provided out of the box in many programming languages. Per Wikipedia:</p>
<p>“In&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science">computer science</a>,  a&nbsp;<strong>generator</strong>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine">routine</a>&nbsp;that can be used to control the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration">iteration</a>&nbsp;behaviour of a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow#Loops">loop</a>. All generators are also&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator">iterators</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generator_(computer_programming)#cite_note-1">[1]</a>&nbsp;A generator is very similar to a function that returns an array, in that a generator has parameters, can be called, and generates a sequence of values.
However, instead of building an array containing all the values and returning them all at once, a generator yields the values one at a time, which requires less memory and allows the caller to get started processing the first few values immediately. In short, a generator&nbsp;<em>looks like</em>&nbsp;a function but&nbsp;<em>behaves like</em>&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator">iterator</a>.”</p>
<hr>
<h1>The goal of this proposal (major use-cases)</h1>
<p>A generator in XPath should be a tool to easily implement the solutions to the following use-cases:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Processing a huge collection whose members may not all be needed.<br>
A generator will produce only the next member of the collection and only on demand basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Handling a collection containing unknown or infinite number of members.
When requested the next member of the collection the generator will always produce it, if the collection still contains any members. It is the responsibility of the caller to issue only the necessary number of requests for the really needed next members.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What is achieved in both cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>A (next) member is produced only on request. No time is spent on producing all members of the collection.</li>
<li>A (next) member is produced only on request. No memory is consumed to store all members of the collection.</li>
</ul>
<p>A good problem that is based on these use-cases is to generate a collection of the first N members that have some wanted properties,  and are generated from other collection(s), when it is not known what the size of the original input collections would be in order for the desired number of N members to be discovered.</p>
<p>For example: <strong><em>Produce the first 1 000 000 (1M) prime numbers</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Sometimes we may not even know if N such wanted members actually exist, for example: <strong><em>Produce the first 2 sequences of 28 prime numbers where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primes_in_arithmetic_progression#Largest_known_primes_in_AP">the primes in each of the sequences form an arithmetic progression</a>.</em></strong></p>
<hr>
<h1>The Proposal</h1>
<p>A generator is defined as (and synonym for):</p>
<pre><code class="language-xq">let $generator as record
                   (initialized as xs:boolean,
                    endReached as xs:boolean,
                    getCurrent as function(..) as item()*,
                    moveNext as function(..) as .. ,
                    *  ) 
</code></pre>
<p>A generator is an extensible <a href="https://qt4cg.org/pr/715/xquery-40/xpath-40.html#id-record-test"><strong><em>record</em></strong> </a>.</p>
<p>It has four fixed-named keys, and any other map-keys, as required to hold the internal state of that specific generator.</p>
<p>Here is the meaning of  the four fixed/named keys:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><em>initialized</em></strong> is a boolean. When a generator <code>$gen</code>  is initially instantiated, <code>$gen?initialized</code> is <code>false()</code>. Any call to <code>$gen?getCurrent()</code> raises an error. In order to get the first value of the represented collection, the caller must call <code>$gen?moveNext()</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>endReached</em></strong> is a boolean. If after a call to <code>moveNext()</code> the value of the returned generator's <code>endReached</code> key is <code>true()</code> then calling <code>moveNext()</code> and/or <code>getCurrent()</code> on this generator raises an error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>getCurrent</em></strong> is a function of zero arguments. It must only be called if the values of <code>initialized</code> is <code>true()</code> and the value of <code>endReached</code> is <code>false()</code>, otherwise an error must be raised. This function produces the current member of the collection after the last call to <code>moveNext</code>, if this call didn't return a generator whose <code>endReached</code> value was <code>true()</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>moveNext</em></strong>  is a function of zero arguments. When called on a generator whose <code>endReached</code> value is <code>false()</code> then it produces the next (state of the) generator. including a possibly <code>true()</code> value of <code>endReached</code> and if this value is still <code>false()</code>, then calling <code>getCurrent()</code> produces the value of the next member of the collection.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Examples of operations on generators</h1>
<p>The following examples are written in pseudo-code as at the time of writing there was no available implementation of records. And also, the code for recursion in pure XPath makes any such example longer than necessary for grasping its meaning.</p>

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Here are some other useful functions on generators -- with just their signature and summary</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>concat($gen1 as generator , $gen2 as generator )</strong> - produces a generator that behaves as <code>$gen1</code> until <code>$gen1.endReached</code> becomes <code>true()</code>,  and then behaves as <code>$gen2</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>append($gen as generator, $value as item()*)</strong> - produces a generator that behaves as <code>$gen</code> until <code>$gen.endReached</code> becomes <code>true()</code>,  and then as a generator that has only the single value <code>value</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>prepend($gen as generator, $value as item()*)</strong> - produces a generator whose first value is <code>value</code> and then behaves as <code>$gen</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>some($gen as generator) as xs:boolean</strong> - Produces <code>true()</code> if <code>$gen</code> has at least one value, and <code>false()</code> otherwise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>some($gen as generator, $pred as function(item()*) as xs:boolean) as xs:boolean</strong> - Produces <code>true()</code> if <code>$gen</code> has at least one value for which $pred($thisValue) is true(), and <code>false()</code> otherwise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ofType($gen as generator, $type as type)</strong>  - Produces a new generator from <code>$gen</code> that contains all values from <code>$gen</code> of type <code>type</code> -- for this we need to have added to the language the <strong>type</strong> object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>skipWhile($gen as generator, $pred as function(item()*) as xs:boolean)</strong>  - Produces a new generator from <code>$gen</code> by skipping all starting values for which <code>$pred($theValue)</code> is <code>true()</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>takeWhile($gen as generator, $pred as function(item()*) as xs:boolean)</strong>  - Produces a new generator from <code>$gen</code> which contains all starting values of <code>$gen</code> for which <code>$pred($theValue)</code> is <code>true()</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>toArray($gen as generator)</strong> - Produces an array that contains all values that are contained in <code>$gen</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>toSequence($gen as generator)</strong> - Produces a sequence that contains all values that are contained in <code>$gen</code>. Values of <code>$gen</code> that are sequences themselves are flattened.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>toMap($gen as generator)</strong> - If the values in $gen are all key-value pairs, produces a map that contains exactly all the key-value pairs from <code>$gen</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>These and many other useful functions on generators can and should be added to every generator upon construction.</p>
<p>Thus, it would be good to have an explicit constructor function for a generator:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xq">     construct-generator($record as 
                               record( initialized as xs:boolean,

                                       getCurrent as function(..) as item()*,
                                       moveNext as function(..) as .. ,
                                      )
                         ) as generator

<blockquote>
<p>For avoidance of doubt, we should say in XQuery 4.6.2.4 (Named Function References) that the function created by a named function reference has its annotations taken from the function definition. There are other places where we are not explicit about the annotations of a function item, for example with partial function application. We should add a note that in XPath and XSLT, it is not possible to define function annotations, so this function will always return an empty result. (However, we should consider giving user-defined functions in XSLT annotations based on their attributes, e.g. visibility and streamability).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…and my complementary note in the PR thread:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I decided to merge the PR without changes, and not add the reference to XPath and XSLT, because the function may also return results for XQuery functions imported via fn:load-xquery-module.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additional notes from today’s meeting:</p>
<ul>
<li>For annotations without values, we could assign <code>true()</code> as a default value.</li>
<li>Examples could be added to <code>fn:function-annotations</code> to demonstrate how to check for annotations without values (or with values whose EBV is <code>false()</code>: <code>0</code>, <code>""</code>, etc.).</li>
<li>Dimitre suggested restructuring the spec for features that are not available in XPath.</li>
<li>Maybe annotations would also be helpful in XPath.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free everyone to add more comments.</p>

<p>I think the type for the 3rd argument of <code>fn:sort</code>…</p>
<pre><code>$key  as&nbsp;(function(item()) as xs:anyAtomicType*)+  :=&nbsp;fn:data#1

<p>While it will be rare to encounter queries with <code>key := ()</code>, there seems to be no urgent reason to enforce at least one sort key. The change would also be in alignment with the corresponding rule (with the current signature, <code>$key</code> cannot be empty), which says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The number of sort key definitions is determined by the number of function items supplied in the <code>$key</code> argument. If the argument is absent or empty, the default is a single sort key definition using the function <code>data#1</code>.</p>

It's related to the requirements presented in issue #262 and issue #297.</p>
<p>Firstly, I propose a change to the data model so that annotations can be attached to any item [or perhaps any value?], not only to a function. The annotations are a map of type <code>map{xs:QName, item()*}</code>. Some general principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Annotations on an item do not affect the result of any operation on that item unless otherwise specified.</li>
<li>Operations that are described as returning a result that contains items that are present in one of the operation's operands retain the annotations of those items, unless otherwise specified. (So for example $a[C] returns a sequence of items from $a in which the annotations are preserved).</li>
<li>Operations that construct "new" items (for example $a + $b) return an item with no annotations, unless otherwise specified.</li>
<li>The function <code>annotations($x)</code> (replacing <code>function-annotations($x)</code>) returns the annotations of an item.</li>
<li>The function annotate($x, key, value) returns a "clone" of $x with an additional annotation. (A clone of an item differs from the original only in having different annotations. All operations other than annotation-sensitive operations produce exactly the same result on the clone and the original - including tests for node identity.)</li>
<li>To avoid confusion, the term "type annotation" is replaced by "type label".</li>
</ul>
<p>Secondly, we use annotations to aid navigation of JTrees (a term I use to describe trees of arrays and maps such as might be produced by parsing JSON).</p>
<p>We introduce a component of the static context <code>tracked=true|false</code>, defaulting to false. The construct <code>tracked{expression}</code> evaluates an expression and its subexpressions in tracked mode. In tracked mode any operator or function that performs selection within an array or map (for example the lookup operator, the <code>map:get</code> and <code>array:get</code> function, using the map/array as a function item, or the <code>array:head()</code> and <code>array:foot()</code> and <code>map:find()</code> functions) annotates the items in its result with two properties: "container" whose value is the map or array from which the item was selected, and "key" which is the key or array index of the selected value within that container. The effect is that if an item was found in a JTree using a tracked expression, the annotations on the resulting item can be used in effect to navigate upwards within the tree that was searched.</p>
<p>Note that this is not a new idea: in effect, the result of a tracked selection is a <strong>zipper</strong> data structure, as described in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipper_(data_structure).</p>
<p>A further exploitation of the idea allows us to introduce deep update of JTree structures. For example, <code>modify(root:=$a, selection:=fn{?x?y?z,} change:=fn{.+1})</code> can evaluate the <code>selection</code> argument in tracked mode, apply the <code>change</code> function to the resulting items, and then navigate back using the <code>container</code> annotation to create modified versions of all traversed containing JTrees, eventually returning a modified version of the <code>root</code> tree.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I've been thinking recently about adding <code>checked{}</code> and <code>unchecked{}</code> modes. For example</p>
<p>&lt;xsl:apply-templates select="checked{.//item}"/&gt;</p>
<p>would throw an error if there are no items. The mode of execution would propagate downwards, so <code>checked{a/b/c/d}</code> would be able to tell you that a <code>b</code> was found, but it had no <code>c</code> children.</p>
<p><code>checked{item[22]}</code> would have the effect of making sequences behave more like arrays, with bound checking; conversely <code>unchecked{item?22}</code> would return an empty sequence instead of throwing an error.</p>

<p>The motivations for this are to explore the creation of sequences where the next item in the sequence is determined by evaluating a function on the current state of a system. These sequence generators have an initial starting value and state. They can also stop when some condition is met.</p>
<p>The motivating example here is the <a href="https://qt4cg.org/specifications/xpath-functions-40/Overview.html#func-random-number-generator">fn:random-number-generator</a> function, where:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>let $rnd := fn:random-number-generator()</code> initializes a new random number sequence with the default seed as its state;</li>
<li><code>let $value := $rnd?number</code> returns the current value of the sequence;</li>
<li><code>let $rnd := $rnd?next()</code> returns the state and value of the next item in the sequence.</li>
</ol>
<p>This has all the properties needed for a forward (left-to-right) generating sequence. To make it a generalized generator sequence, the <code>number</code> field should be renamed <code>value</code>.</p>
<p>NOTE: The <code>fn:random-number-generator</code> function defines an infinite sequence as it has no termination/end of sequence condition.</p>
<h2>Sequence Generators as Record Types</h2>
<p>Therefore, a forward generator sequence could look like this:</p>
<pre><code>declare item-type sequence-generator as record(
    value as item(),
    next as function() as record(value, next, *)?,
    *
);

declare function generated-sequence() as sequence-generator?;
</code></pre>
<p>If calling <code>?next()</code> on a sequence above returns the empty sequence then there are no more values in that sequence.</p>
<p>If the <code>generated-sequence()</code> returns the empty sequence then there are no items in the sequence.</p>
<p>NOTE: This does not currently define reversible sequence support. A <code>reversed</code> property could be provided that returns a <code>sequence-generator</code> that operates on the sequence from right to left. I haven't figured out exactly how this should look, but reversed generator sequences may be better investigated as a separate issue.</p>
<p>NOTE: An implementation can process this sequence iteratively if needed.</p>
<h3>Analysis</h3>
<p>While this allows generator sequence types to be created, they are -- like <code>fn:random-number-generator()</code> cumbersome to use. This does have the advantage of being backward compatible with <code>fn:random-number-generator()</code>, though.</p>
<p>The problem comes when trying to make these work like sequences. The subtype and function coercion rules should be doable. The other sequence operations like filtering are more complicated to define properly.</p>
<p>However, this has the same issues that allowing <code>array()</code> in <code>fn:*</code> functions has -- how do you differentiate the use cases where the user is working on a sequence of generators, or the generated sequences?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: You can't extend the functions to take a <code>(sequence-type | item()*)</code> parameter as a <code>sequence-type</code> is a subtype of <code>item()</code> which matches <code>item()*</code>. If the functions were to be extended to handle these, then <code>fn:head(fn:random-number-generator())</code> would return a number instead of a map.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Sequence Generator Function</h2>
<p>The Kotlin language has a <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.sequences/generate-sequence.html">generateSequence</a> function that takes a next function, an optional seed value or construction function, and returns a lazy sequence over that. -- Internally, it is building a Java iterator that produces values from calling the next function. The sequence will terminate when the next value is null.</p>
<p>I propose that -- in addition to the <code>sequence-generator</code> type above -- XPath defines the following function:</p>
<pre><code>declare function fn:sequence($generator as sequence-generator) as item()*;
</code></pre>
<p>This solves the issues in the <em>Analysis</em> section above, and is analogous to <code>array:values</code>. It is implementation defined how the sequence is constructed. -- This allows an implementer to appropriately map the generator to their internal sequence implementation in order to provide lazy evaluation and other operations.</p>
<p>There should also be the following helper function for random numbers:</p>
<pre><code>declare function fn:random-numbers(
    $seed as xs:anyAtomicType? := ()
) as xs:double* {
    fn:random-number-generator() =&gt; fn:sequence()
};
</code></pre>
<p>The user-defined sequences then become e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>let $generator as sequence-generator := map {
    value : 1,
    next : function () { () }
}
return fn:sequence($generator)
</code></pre>

While this is unrewardingly confusing for binary operations (<code>() + 1</code>, <code>() eq 5</code>), it’s wonderful for pipelines:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">(: paths :)
$nodes / a / b / c
(: lookups :)
$data ? 1 ? 2 ? 3
(: simple map operators :)
$data ! do(.) ! something(.)
(: arrow operator works differently, but the syntax is similar:  :)
$data =&gt; do() =&gt; something()
</code></pre>
<p>As far as I can judge, it would be a very simple and user-friendly addition if we extended dynamic function calls to return an empty sequence (instead of raising an error) if the base expression is an empty sequence. This way, the following expressions would all run through:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">let $map := map { 'giovanni': map { 'city': 'roma' } }
return $map('andrea')('city'),
let $data := ()
return $data(1)(2)(3),
()(123),
()()
</code></pre>
<p>Many people use parentheses instead of the lookup operator for accessing maps &amp; arrays, and the proposed change would make the syntax more interchangeable. I believe it would also be useful for function items in general.</p>

<pre><code class="language-xquery">(: valid :)
for $a in 1 to 10
for $m member $m in $array

(: invalid :)
for $a in 1 to 10, member $m in $array
</code></pre>
<p>In addition, the keyword applies to all other bindings in the same <code>for</code> clause:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">for member $m1 in $array1, $m2 in $array2
</code></pre>
<p>My feeling is that this syntax is a bit odd, as other keywords (<code>allowing empty</code>, <code>at</code>) only refer to the currently bound variable. Next, the <code>member</code> syntax would differ from the semantics of XQuery Full Text: The <code>score</code> keyword is placed before the variable name, and can be used more than once (or omitted):</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">let score $s1 := $data1, score $s2 := $data2
</code></pre>
<p>I think we should change this. It would also simplify the grammar:</p>
<pre><code>InitialClause     ::=  ForClause | LetClause | WindowClause
ForClause         ::=  "for" ForBinding ("," ForBinding)*
ForBinding        ::=  (SimpleForBinding | ForMemberBinding) PositionalVar? "in" ExprSingle
SimpleForBinding  ::=  VarBinding AllowingEmpty?
ForMemberBinding  ::=  "member" VarBinding
AllowingEmpty     ::=  "allowing" "empty"
PositionalVar     ::=  "at" "$" VarName
VarBinding        ::=  "$" VarName TypeDeclaration?
</code></pre>
<p>And one more motivation for changing is that map bindings will be easier to define (see <a href="https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/31#issuecomment-1721400625">#31</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If F has lower arity than the expected type, then F is wrapped in a new function that declares and ignores the additional argument; the following steps are then applied to this new function.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If I got it right, this is the resulting 4.0 behavior:</p>
<p><strong>Spoiler:</strong> I probably got it wrong, see the next comment.</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">declare function local:function($a) { };
declare variable $function := function($a) { };

(: now legal :)
filter    (1984, true#0)
$function (1984, 'ignored')
fn { }    (1984, 'ignored')
map { }   (1984, 'ignored')
true#0    ('ignored')
sum(?, ())(1984, 'ignored')

(: still illegal :)
local:function(1984, 'ignored')

(: still legal: RHS items will be supplied one by one :)
map { }(1984, 'processed')     
</code></pre>
<p>Maybe some more examples should be added in the corresponding sections that refer to function coercion.</p>
<p>The new rule is powerful and allows for greater flexibility (see #516 and other issues), but the behavior may also be unexpected. We should probably document that:</p>
<ul>
<li>It may go unnoticed that a passed on argument will be ignored. In other words, we reduce type safety by allowing users to supply more arguments than will be processed.</li>
<li>It makes a difference whether the invoked function is static or dynamic (dynamic functions will now provide less type safety than static functions).</li>
</ul>

<p>I propose <code>A!!B</code> as a mapping operator for arrays. Unlike <code>!</code>, this does not flatten the result. The result is an array whose members correspond one-to-one with the members of <code>A</code>, each member of the result array being formed by evaluating <code>B</code> with the corresponding member of <code>A</code> as the context value.</p>
<p>For an array whose members are singletons, the expression <code>A!!B</code> has a similar effect to <code>A?*!B</code>, but (a) it is clearer, (b) it returns an array rather than a sequence, and (c) it performs no flattening. For the more general case, it can be used in place of the higher-order function call <code>A =&gt; array:for-each(fn{B})</code>.</p>
<p>I propose <code>A?[B]</code> as a filter operator for arrays. Unlike <code>A[B]</code>, this is not overloaded to perform index-based selection. The result is an array containing those members of <code>A</code> for which <code>B</code> has an effective boolean value of true, when evaluated with the corresponding member of <code>A</code> as the context value. The expression <code>$A?[B]</code> is equivalent to <code>$A =&gt; array:filter(fn{B})</code>.</p>
<p>For example, <code>$A?[exists(.)]</code> filters the array <code>$A</code> to retain only those members that are non-empty.</p>

Many other languages provide a similar function: The returned output can possibly help to understand which function calls led to an error during the evaluation of a code.</p>
<p>Still, I have strong doubts that it is a good decision to include this function in the standard:</p>
<p>The specification gives you a vast amount of freedom how to implement and optimize things. As a result, it’s completely feasible and reasonable to rewrite the following code…</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">declare function local:double($f) {
  $f * 2
};
(1 to 6) ! local:double(.)
</code></pre>
<p>…to <code>(1 to 6) ! (. * 2)</code> at compile time. If a user adds a <code>fn:stack-overflow</code> call in the function body, s·he would expect to find the function invocation of the original code representation in the output. As always, there are technical solutions to achieve this (store additional information in the evaluation tree on the original query; suppress optimizations when <code>fn:stack-trace</code> is found), but all of them can affect the runtime behavior and lead to different evaluation trees, hiding possible bugs in the implementation (which can be a reason to call <code>fn:stack-trace</code> at all).</p>
<p>A standard should provide a minimum amount of assurance that a function behaves similarly across different implementations. At this time, I don’t believe we can’t give that guarantee.</p>
<p>Related: #55, #686</p>
<p>– As an alternative, a stack trace could optionally be created by an implementation when an error is triggered.</p>

<p>For union types (including both schema-defined and locally-defined union types), the rules appear to need some further work. Given types <code>R1</code> and <code>R2</code> that are defined by restriction from <code>B1</code> and <code>B2</code>, if an atomic value <code>V</code> is an instance of <code>B1</code> that conforms to the rules of <code>R1</code>, then the relabelling coercion means it V will now be acceptable where the required type is <code>R1</code>. But if the required type is <code>union(R1, R2)</code>, the relabelling coercion is not invoked. This feels inconsistent, since <code>union(R1, R2)</code> might be expected to accept anything that <code>R1</code> accepts.</p>
<p>Test case FunctionCall-056 (currently failing) illlustrates the problem.</p>

<p>Constructor functions for user-defined types are very poorly described:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It's unclear how anonymous types are handled. The spec says there is a constructor function for every simple type in the static context. That would include anonymous types. But constructor functions for anonymous types, if they exist, are essentially useless, because their names are not known.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The semantics of constructor functions for user-defined list and union types are described very vaguely, by analogy with built-in types; and the analogy points to the section on built-in atomic types which doesn't cover union and list types.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a union type <code>U</code>, it says that the return type of the constructor U(x) is defined as <code>xs:anyAtomicType</code>. Why not define it as <code>U</code>? Perhaps this predates the ability to use union types as return types.</p>

<div class="toot" id="created-686"><h2>Issue #686 created<span class="toot-id"> #created-686</span></h2><div class="pubdate">06 Sep at 21:28:53 GMT</div><div class="link">Link: <a href="https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/686">https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/686</a></div><details><summary>XQFO presentation of diagnostic functions</summary><div class="markup"><p>From an informal discussion on Slack, I feel that clarity is needed in the <a href="https://qt4cg.org/specifications/xpath-functions-40/Overview.html#diagnostics">Diagnostic tracing</a> section. The problem is that <code>fn:trace()</code> and <code>fn:log()</code> introduce the terms "trace output" with no definition or explanation, and this is easily confused with the primary output defined by the function signatures, and affects how readers think about the determinism of the functions. "The serialization of the trace output..." implies that the processor will necessarily serialize something, but I doubt that can or should be presumed. More needs to be said about the responsibilities of the processor in the contract for these functions.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this section would benefit from a brief preamble, providing context to set the stage for the rules. Some draft text for us to discuss:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Diagnostic tracing functions provide a transfer of information, either from the processor to the dynamic context, or vice versa.</p>
<p>The function that transfers information from the processor to the dynamic context, <code>fn:stack-trace()</code>, returns a string that can be further processed and used in the XPath expression and elsewhere in a host language.</p>
<p>The functions that transfer information from the dynamic context to the processor, <code>fn:trace()</code> and <code>fn:log()</code>, each have two effects. The first effect, the output, pertains to the returned values, defined by the function signature and essential to the XPath expression. Such output is always deterministic. The second effect, processor behavior, concerns the way the processor handles the values bound to the parameters, supplied for diagnostic tracing. Processor behavior is always directed toward the user or environment that invoked the processor. Actions may include sending messages, serializing the values and writing them to a log file or database, or something else. Unlike the output (the first effect), the results of processor behavior are implementation-defined and nondeterministic with respect to order of the parameter values.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The draft above attempts to avoid "output" to describe the processor-side diagnostics, so as to avoid potential confusion when dealing with the return-type defined in the signature. Where "trace output" appears in each of the rules, "processor behavior" can be used instead.</p>
<p>Questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any objections, corrections, or suggestions?</li>
<li>Any other examples of how a processor might use trace diagnostics?</li>
<li>Should a paragraph be added to explain briefly how <code>trace()</code> and <code>log()</code> differ from <code>xsl:message</code>? (E.g., a serialized tree should not be presumed.)</li>
<li>In the informal Balisage birds-of-a-feather discussion this summer, reservations were expressed by participants about the name <code>log()</code>. Is it possible to drop the function and simply extend the arity of <code>trace()</code> with a parameter <code>$return-input as xs:boolean? := true()</code>?</li>
</ul>

A fix and Proposal for fn:fold-lazy</summary><div class="markup"><h1><strong>The trouble with XPath‘s fn:fold-right.</strong><br><strong>Laziness in XPath.</strong></h1>
<p><em>This article discusses the standard XPath 3.1 function <strong>fn:fold-right,</strong> its definition in the official Spec, its lack of apparent use-cases and its utter failure to reproduce the (lazy) behavior of Haskell’s <strong>foldr</strong> , which is presumed to be the motivation behind <strong>fn:fold-right</strong>.</em><br>
<em>The 2nd part of the article introduces the implementation of short-circuiting and generators, which together unprecedentedly provide laziness in XPath. Based on these, a new XPath function: <strong>fn:fold-lazy</strong>    is implemented, that utilizes laziness, similar to Haskell’s <strong>foldr</strong>. This behavior is demonstrated in specific examples</em></p>
<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>Higher order functions were introduced into XPath starting with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions-30/#basic-hofs">version 3.0</a> in 2014 and later in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions-31/#higher-order-functions">version 3.1</a> in 2017.<br>
The definition of the standard function <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions-31/#func-fold-right">fn:fold-right</a> closely mimics that of Haskell’s <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.18.0.0/docs/Prelude.html#g:11">foldr</a>, and anyone acquainted with <strong>foldr</strong> can be left with the impression that <strong>fn:fold-right</strong> would have identical behavior (and hence use-cases) as Haskell’s <strong>foldr</strong>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is a critical difference between the definitions of these two functions. Whereas the definition of <strong>foldr</strong> explicitly defines its behavior when provided with a function, lazy in its 1st argument – from <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.18.0.0/docs/Prelude.html#g:11">Haskell’s definition of
foldr</a>:</p>
<p>“… <em>Note that since the head of the resulting expression is produced by an application of the operator to the first element of the list, given an operator lazy in its right argument,&nbsp;foldr&nbsp;can produce a terminating expression from an unbounded list.”</em></p>
<p>The XPath definition of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions-31/#func-fold-right">fn:fold-right</a> does not mention any laziness.</p>
<p>There is no official concept of “laziness” in XPath, thus <strong>fn:fold-right</strong> doesn’t cover some of the most important use-cases of Haskell’s <strong>foldr</strong> , which can successfully produce a result when passed an infinite (or having unlimited length) list.</p>
<p>This in fact makes <strong>fn:fold-right</strong> almost useless, and explains why even some  of the members of the XPath 3.1 WG have stated on occasions that they do not see why the function was introduced.</p>
<h2><strong>fn:fold-right gone wrong – example</strong></h2>
<p>This Haskell code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-hs">foldr (\x y -&gt; (if x == 0 then 0 else x*y)) 1 (map (\x -&gt; x - 15) [1 ..1000000])

foldr (\x y -&gt; (if x == 0 then 0 else x*y)) 1 (map (\x -&gt; x - 15) [1 ..10000000])

foldr (\x y -&gt; (if x == 0 then 0 else x*y)) 1 (map (\x -&gt; x - 15) [1 ..])
</code></pre>
<p>produces the product of all numbers in the following list, respectively:</p>
<p>[-14, -13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, <strong>0</strong>, 1, 2, 3, …, 999985]</p>
<p>[-14, -13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, <strong>0</strong>, 1, 2, 3, …, 9999985]</p>
<p>[-14, -13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, <strong>0</strong>, 1, 2, 3, …, ] -- up to infinity.</p>
<p>Because all these <code>3</code> lists contain a zero as their 15th item, the expected result is <strong><code>0</code></strong> when evaluating any of these <code>3</code> expressions – even in the last case where the provided as argument list is infinite. And this is indeed what happens:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/assets/10605892/4e7cbbc7-543f-433a-bdb6-e25aa59d1172" alt="image"></p>
<p>Not only Haskell produces the correct result in all cases, but <em>regardless of the list’s length, the result is produced instantaneously</em>!</p>
<p>Now, let us evaluate this equivalent XPath expression with BaseX:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xq">let $product := function($input as array(xs:integer)) as xs:integer
                         { 
                           array:fold-right($input, 1, function($x as xs:integer, $y as xs:integer) as  xs:integer 
                                                               {if($x eq 0) then 0 else $x * $y}) 
                         },
    $ar := array { (1 to 36) ! function($x as xs:integer) as xs:integer {$x -15}(.)}
  return
     $product($ar)

</code></pre>
<p>Here we are passing a list containing just 36 integers. The result is quite unexpected and spectacular:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/assets/10605892/83a86918-deb3-4f4a-9b2f-38bab85d863f" alt="image"></p>
<p>Here is what happens:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Even though when processing the 15th integer in the array the result is 0, the XPath processor continues to evaluate the RHS (right-hand side) until the last member of the array (<code>36</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On “its way back” the XPath processor multiplies: <code>(36*35*34*33*32* …*6*5*4)*3</code>, and the result of the right-most multiplication is bigger than the maximum integer (or decimal) that this XPath processor supports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>C r r r a s s h</strong> … As seen in the screenshot above.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The root cause for this unfortunate behavior is that the XPath processor doesn’t support short-circuiting and laziness. And thus, <strong>fn:fold-right</strong> is useless even in the normal/trivial case of a collection (array) with only 36 members. Not to speak of collections containing millions of members, or even infinite ones…</p>
<p>Let us see what happens when evaluating similar expressions with another XPath processor: Saxon.</p>
<p>Saxon seems to produce the correct result, however it takes exponentially longer times when the length of the passed array is increased, leading to this one:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/assets/10605892/e0b9e34e-b58e-4100-a22a-48581be84072" alt="image"></p>
<p>It took 261 seconds for the evaluation to be done, but accessing the <code>15</code>th member of the array and short-circuiting to <code>0</code> should be almost instantaneous…<br>
So what happens in this case? The difference between BaseX and Saxon is that Saxon implements a “Big Integer” and thus can multiply almost <code>1 000 000</code> integers without getting a value that cannot be handled… But doing almost <code>1</code>M multiplications of big integers obviously takes time …</p>
<p>What is common in these two examples? Obviously, neither BaseX nor Saxon detects and performs short-circuiting. Why is this? What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>I asked a developer of BaseX if I could submit a bug about this behavior. His answer was shockingly unexpected: “<em>This is not a bug, because no requirement in the Specification has been violated</em>”.</p>
<p>Thus, the main cause of the common behavior of both XPath processors to handle the evaluation of these examples, is the specification of the function, which blatantly allows such crap to happen.</p>
<p>Now that we see this, let us try to provide the wanted, useful behavior writing our own function.</p>
<h2><strong>The fix: Step 1 – fn:fold-right in pure XPath</strong></h2>
<p>Before going in depth with our pure XPath solution, we need as a base a pure-XPath implementation of <strong>fn:fold-right</strong> .</p>
<pre><code class="language-xq"> let $fold-right-inner := function ($seq as item()*,
                                    $zero as item()*,
                                    $f as function(item(), item()*) as item()* ,
                                    $self as function(*)
                                   ) as item()*
{
  if(empty($seq)) then $zero
    else
      $f(head($seq), $self(tail($seq), $zero, $f, $self))
},

    $fold-right := function ($seq as item()*,
                             $zero as item()*,
                             $f as function(item(), item()*) as item()* 
                            ) as item()*
{
  $fold-right-inner($seq, $zero, $f, $fold-right-inner)
},
               
   $fAdd := function($x, $y)  {$x + $y},
   $fMult  := function($x, $y)  {$x * $y}
   
   return
     $fold-right((1 to 6) ! function($x){$x - 3}(.), 1, $fMult)
</code></pre>
<p>When we evaluate the above with any of the two XPath processors, the correct result is produced:</p>
<p>0</p>
<p>And we certainly do have exactly the same problems as the provided built-in <strong>fn:fold-right</strong> with a similar example:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/assets/10605892/b65e72b1-a5a6-4f73-b485-c316a05f3cc4" alt="image"></p>
<h2><strong>The fix: Step 2 – <code>$fold-right-sc</code> detecting and performing short-circuiting</strong></h2>
<p>Now that we have <strong><code>$fold-right</code></strong> as a base, let us add code to it so that it  will detect and perform short-circuiting. We will implement a function similar to <strong><code>$fold-right</code></strong> but having this signature:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xq">    $fold-right-sc := function ($seq as item()*,
                                $zero as item()*,
                                $f as function(item(), item()*) as item()*,
                                $fGetPartial as function(*)
                               ) as item()*
</code></pre>
<p>The last of the function’s parameters <code>$fGetPartial</code> returns a new function that is the partial application of <code>$f</code>, when its 1st argument is set to the current member of the input sequence <code>$seq</code>. The idea is that whenever short-circuiting is possible, <code>$fGetPartial</code> returns not a function having one argument (arity <code>1</code>), but a constant – a function with <code>0</code> arguments (arity <code>0</code>).</p>
<p>If the arity of the so produced partial application is <code>0</code>, then our code will immediately return with the value <code>$f($currentItem)</code>.</p>
<p>Here is the complete code of <code>$fold-right-sc</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xq"> let $fold-right-sc-inner := function ($seq as item()*,
                                       $zero as item()*,
                                       $f as function(item(), item()*) as item()*,
                                       $fGetPartial as function(*),
                                       $self as function(*)
                                      ) as item()*
{
  if(empty($seq)) then $zero
    else
      if(function-arity($fGetPartial(head($seq), $zero)) eq 0)
        then $fGetPartial(head($seq), $zero) ()
        else $f(head($seq), $self(tail($seq), $zero, $f, $fGetPartial, $self))
},

    $fold-right-sc := function ($seq as item()*,
                                $zero as item()*,
                                $f as function(item(), item()*) as item()*,
                                $fGetPartial as function(*)
                               ) as item()*
{
  $fold-right-sc-inner($seq, $zero, $f, $fGetPartial, $fold-right-sc-inner)
},
               
   $fAdd := function($x, $y)  {$x + $y},
   $fMult  := function($x, $y)  {if($x eq 0) then 0 else $x * $y},
   $fMultGetPartial := function($x, $y)
   {
     if($x eq 0)
       then function() {0}
       else function($z) {$x * $z}
   }
   
   return
     $fold-right-sc((1 to 1000000) ! function($x){$x - 3}(.), 1, $fMult, $fMultGetPartial)

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Do note</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If the current item (the head of the sequence) is <code>0</code>, then <code>$fMultGetPartial</code> returns a function with <code>0</code> arguments (constant) that produces <code>0</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>$fold-right-sc</code> (inner) treats differently a partial application of arity <code>0</code> from a partial application with arity <code>1</code>. In the former case it simply produces the expected constant value without recursing further. Here is the relevant code fragment</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-xq">  if(empty($seq)) then $zero
    else
      if(function-arity($fGetPartial(head($seq), $zero)) eq 0)
        then $fGetPartial(head($seq), $zero) ()
        else $f(head($seq), $self(tail($seq), $zero, $f, $fGetPartial, $self))
</code></pre>
<p>And now BaseX has no problems with the evaluation, even though the input sequence is of size 1M. The complete evaluation takes just a fraction of a millisecond (0.04 ms):</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/assets/10605892/3eec8eba-95e9-4ef4-bc4f-a1c5b9a3f0fc" alt="image"></p>
<p>With Saxon things are not so good. Even though Saxon produces the correct result, evaluating the expression with an input sequence of size 1M takes 0.5 seconds (half a second), and evaluating the expression with an input sequence of 10M takes 5 seconds (10 times as long):</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/assets/10605892/087c279c-86b9-4b51-a086-eb7c3f85f802" alt="image"></p>
<p><img src="media/92f636bb9993afbd2fc75157f3024f75.png" alt=""></p>
<p>What is happening?</p>
<p>Even though Saxon performs much faster than the previous 261 seconds, due to  detecting the short-circuiting possibility and performing the short-circuit, Saxon still processes all 10M items when evaluating this subexpression (which obviously the more optimized BaseX doesn’t do in advance):</p>
<p><code>(1 to 10000000) ! function($x){$x - 3}(.)</code></p>
<p>Therefore, we have one remaining problem: How to prevent long sequences (or arrays) from being fully materialized before starting the evaluation of <code>$fold-right-sc</code> ?</p>
<h2><strong>The fix: Step 3 – replacing collections with generators</strong></h2>
<p>Generators are well known and provided out of the box in many programming languages. Per Wikipedia:</p>
<p>“In&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science">computer science</a>,  a&nbsp;<strong>generator</strong>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine">routine</a>&nbsp;that can be used to control the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration">iteration</a>&nbsp;behaviour of a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow#Loops">loop</a>. All generators are also&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator">iterators</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generator_(computer_programming)#cite_note-1">[1]</a>&nbsp;A generator is very similar to a function that returns an array, in that a generator has parameters, can be called, and generates a sequence of values.
However, instead of building an array containing all the values and returning them all at once, a generator yields the values one at a time, which requires less memory and allows the caller to get started processing the first few values immediately. In short, a generator&nbsp;<em>looks like</em>&nbsp;a function but&nbsp;<em>behaves like</em>&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator">iterator</a>.”</p>
<p>A full-fledged generator (such as implemented in C#) is an instance of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine">Finite State Machine(FSM)</a>, and implementing it in full generality goes beyond the topic and goals of this article. Expect another article soon that will provide this.</p>
<p>Here we will implement a simple kind of generator, that when passed an integer index <code>$N</code>, produces the <code>$N</code>th item of a specific sequence. Although this is probably the simplest form of a generator, it can be useful in many cases and is a good illustrative solution to our current problem. The whole approach of replacing “something” with a function that must be called to produce this “something” is known as <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Lifting">“lifting”</a></p>
<p>First, we will add to our <code>$fold-right</code> just the use of generators, without the detection and performing of short-circuiting:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xq">let $fold-right-lifted-inner := function ($seqGen as function(xs:integer) as array(*),
                                    $index as xs:integer,
                                    $zero as item()*,
                                    $f as function(item(), item()*) as item()* ,

</code></pre>
<p>Here we see an example of a simple generator – the function <strong><code>$fSeq1ToN</code></strong>.</p>
<p>This function returns an array with two members: a Boolean, which if <code>true()</code> indicates the end of the sequence, and the 2nd member is the current head of the simulated sequence.<br>
The generator has two other parameters which are the values (inclusive) for the start-index and the end-index. Whenever the passed value of <code>$ind</code> is outside of this specified range, <strong><code>$fSeq1ToN</code></strong> returns a result array with its first member set to <code>true()</code> (the 2nd member of the result must be ignored in this case), which indicates end-of sequence.<br>
Otherwise it returns <code>array{false(), $ind}</code> . It is the responsibility of the caller to stop calling the generator:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xq">   $fSeq1ToN := function($ind as xs:integer, $indStart as xs:integer, $indEnd as xs:integer) as array(*)
                {
                  if($ind lt  $indStart or $ind gt $indEnd)
                    then  array{true(), $NaN}
                    else array{false(), $ind}
                }
</code></pre>
<p>Evaluating the complete XPath expression above produces the correct result both in BaseX and in Saxon: the product of the integers <code>1</code> to <code>6</code>:</p>

<h2><br><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
<p>This article demonstrated the problems inherent to the standard XPath <strong>fn:fold-right</strong> and correctly determined the root causes for these problems: no short-circuiting and no collection generators.</p>
<p>Then a step-by-step solution was built that shows how to implement lazy evaluation in XPath based on short-circuiting and collection generators. This fixed the error raised by BaseX and dramatically reduced the evaluation time of
Saxon from <code>261</code> seconds to <code>0</code> seconds.</p>
<p>The new function produced can be called <strong><code>$fold-lazy</code></strong> and is a good candidate for inclusion in the XPath 4.0 standard functions.</p>
<p>A complete design and implementation of a general collection-generator will be published in a separate article.</p>

<p>A sufficient definition is: the comparison of two strings A and B under this collation delivers the same result as the comparison of ascii-lower-case(A) to ascii-lower-case(B) under the Unicode codepoint collation, where ascii-lower-case($S) function is translate($S, "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ", "abcedfghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz").</p>

Currently this is not possible because the relevant namespaces are reserved.</p>
<p>I propose that we relax the rule on reserved function namespaces:</p>
<p>(a) in XQuery, if the function has an annotation along the lines `%polyfill('http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions'), where the parameter indicates that the function should be injected into the specified namespace instead of the namespace of the containing module.</p>
<p>(b) in XSLT, if the attribute <code>xsl:function/@override-extension-function="no"</code> is present. A function is allowed to be in a reserved namespace if this attribute is present.</p>
<p>I've chosen syntax here that's already available in 3.0/3.1, to minimise the impact on existing processors. Of course, we can't retrospectively change the 3.0/3.1 specs to authorise older processors to make this work as intended. But we can suggest that they bend the rules.</p>
<p>In both cases, (a) if the annotation is present then the rules on reserved namespaces don't apply, and (b) the function declaration is ignored if the processor provides its own internal implementation of the function.</p>
<p>I'm proposing to publish polyfill implementations of many of the new functions (not the complex ones like parse-html!). But I don't intend to make this a QT4 deliverable, I'm thinking of doing it as an open source project in GitHub/Saxonica space.</p>

<p>For simple scripts and main modules, the necessity to prefix all functions with a <code>local</code> prefix is cumbersome. Next, it’s counterintuitive as the prefix is not required for variable declarations:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">declare function local:f() { 1 };
declare variable $x := 1;
$x + local:f()
</code></pre>
<p>It’s possible to use <code>declare default function namespace '...';</code>, but that’s doesn’t feel much easier:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">declare default function namespace 'x';
declare function f() { 1 };
f()
</code></pre>
<p>I wonder if we can do one of the following things?</p>
<ol>
<li>Allow functions without namespace (<code>declare function x() {}</code>, <code>declare function Q{}x() {}</code>).</li>
<li>Assign functions without namespace to the default function namespace.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>One solution to more powerful sorting would a variant of fn:sort that uses a comparator function. We've resisted this in the past because we can't trust a user-supplied comparator function to be well behaved (e.g. transitive). I wonder how serious an obstacle this is?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We should try to trust; there are much more hidden pitfalls in the existing language.</p>
<p><code>fn:sort</code> could be extended with a <code>comparator</code> parameter with two arguments and returning <code>xs:boolean</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">(: returns John, Joe, Jim, Jack :)
sort(('Jack', 'Joe', 'Jim', 'John'), comparator := op('&gt;'))

(: returns -1, 2, -3 :)
sort((-3, -1, 2), comparator := fn($a, $b) { abs($a) &lt; abs($b) })
</code></pre>
<p>Obviously, if a comparator is supplied, other parameters (<code>collation(s)</code>, <code>key(s)</code>, <code>ascending</code>, see #623) must not be specified in parallel.</p>

With this change, any XPath expression becomes a valid and equivalent XQuery expression.</p>
<p>This could be done using a new prolog declaration such as</p>
<p><code>declare entity-expansion on|off;</code></p>
<p>If set to "off", <code>&amp;</code> is treated as a normal character in contexts such as string literals and direct element constructors, rather than signalling an entity reference. The default remains "on".</p>

<p>https://www.balisage.net/Proceedings/vol28/html/Holstege01/BalisageVol28-Holstege01.html</p>
<p>It is also motivated by other issues that have been raised here proposing improved capabilities for writing applications in pure XPath.</p>
<p>I propose that we define a syntax for creating a module containing a set of function definitions that can be used to define a function library available to both XQuery and XSLT applications, and potentially also by pure XPath applications. A file should contain all the functions in one namespace. The format should be suitable for translation into other formats such as XSLT and XQuery, which means it should be in XML (though we could also consider JSON). We should provide XSLT stylesheets that convert libraries in this format into XSLT stylesheet modules or XQuery library modules.</p>
<p>Function signatures should be expressed in an XML syntax similar to <code>xsl:function</code> in XSLT.</p>
<p>Function bodies should generally be written in the form of a single XPath expression, though there should be fallback mechanisms to allow XSLT and XQuery implementations to be supplied in cases where XPath lacks sufficient expressive power.</p>
<p>There should be mechanisms to define the more important components of the static context, such as namespace bindings and dependencies on other function libraries.</p>
<p>We could consider using this format to publish "polyfill" implementations of many of the new XPath 4.0 functions.</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;xsl:array version="4.0"&gt;
      &lt;xsl:fallback select="array{1 to 10}"/&gt;
      &lt;xsl:sequence select="1 to 10"/&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:array&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Now, the <code>xsl:fallback</code> instruction doesn't allow an <code>@select</code> attribute; and there's not much point in adding one, because xsl:fallback is only there for a processor implementing XSLT 1.0, 2.0, or 3.0, and such processors will ignore anything the XSLT 4.0 specification says.</p>
<p>However, we could supply some clarification of what such a processor is expected to do when it finds an <code>xsl:fallback</code> element with an unexpected <code>@select</code> attribute. At present, it seems that because we don't say anything else, the <code>xsl:fallback</code> element is itself evaluated in forwards compatibility mode, which means that the select attribute is ignored. Since the whole purpose of xsl:fallback is to provide code that an earlier XSLT processor can handle, I think it would make much more sense to say: "the effective version for an xsl:fallback element and its descendants, unless overridden with an explicit [xsl:]version attribute, is the version of the processor in use", so a 3.0 processor executing an <code>xsl:fallback</code> instruction in a 4.0 stylesheet reports a static error if it finds a construct like the above.</p>
<p>Although the 4.0 spec cannot dictate what a 3.0 processor does, we could add a non-normative note encouraging this interpretation.</p>

<p>For "import schema" it's still completely vague what is intended, and there's no analogy in XSD or XSLT which only ever allow a single location URI to be supplied. Currently we say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The URILiterals that follow the at keyword are optional location hints, and can be interpreted or disregarded in an implementation-dependent way. Multiple location hints might be used to indicate more than one possible place to look for the schema or multiple physical resources to be assembled to form the schema.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I propose changing this to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The URILiterals that follow the at keyword are optional location hints, intended to allow a processor to locate schema documents containing definitions of the required schema components in the target namespace. Processors may interpret or disregard these hints in an implementation-dependent way. The <em>recommended</em> default strategy is as follows (but this may be varied through user options):</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>All the location hints are dereferenced, treating them as relative URIs</li>
<li>If any location hint cannot be dereferenced, or fails to resolve to a valid schema document with the required target namespace, then that location hint is disregarded (optionally with a warning); but if none of the location hints can be resolved to a valid schema document with the required target namespace, then a static error is reported.</li>
<li>If multiple location hints are dereferenced, yielding multiple schema documents A, B, and C, then they should be treated as if there were a single schema document containing <code>xs:include</code> declarations referencing A, B, and C. This implies that the schema documents must together comprise a valid schema, for example there cannot be two different type definitions with the same name.</li>
<li>Notwithstanding the previous rule, if a processor is able to establish that two or more location hints refer to identical or equivalent schema documents, then the duplicates should be ignored.</li>
</ul>
<p>This text gives users and implementors alike a much better sense of what is intended, while still retaining flexibility for implementations to do something different.</p>

<p>The rationale is that (a) serialization is often used in contexts like xsl:message where the primary purpose is diagnostic, and the last thing you want when producing diagnostics is a secondary error; and (b) seeing a fallback representation of an inappropriate value often shows you much more clearly what you have done wrong than any error message can do.</p>
<p>Compare with the <code>.toString()</code> method in Java and similar languages, which always outputs something even if it's not quite what you wanted.</p>
<p>I'm not proposing to change the principle that the output should always be syntactically valid (e.g. well formed XML or JSON).</p>
<p>I think some of the specific error conditions we might drop are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In sequence normalization rule 7, instead of raising an error when an attribute, namespace, or function (including a map or array) is encountered, serialize that item using the adaptive output method, treat the result as a text node, and insert the text node into sequence S6.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the JSON output method: when a sequence of two or more items is encountered, instead of raising SERE0023, treat it as an array containing those items.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Closely related, and perhaps best considered together: should the <code>fn:string()</code> function accept anything as input, and never raise an error?</p>

I'm looking at <a href="https://qt4cg.org/specifications/xquery-40/xpath-40-diff.html#id-conditionals">4.16 of the current version of XPath 4.0</a> and the ternary operator is presented as illustrative, but the operator does not appear to have been properly introduced and defined in the specs. The terms "ternary", "??", and "!!" appear only twice each, and in contexts that could be confused as being illustrative.</p>
<p>By my reading, the definition of <code>[11] ExprSingle</code> should be expanded to allow a new option, call it <code>TernaryOption</code>, and to the grammar should be new entry <code>TernaryOption ::= Expr "??" ExprSingle "!!" ExprSingle</code>. Does such a definition allow any ambiguous constructs?</p>
<p>I propose that 4.16 be subdivided into two subsections, the first one briefly introducing the ternary operator and the second handling if/then statements. Slight aside: the latter should also include a note pointing out how to avoid a then branch (and an example), a courtesy to developers who are overly accustomed to the unbraced approach as to not give the braced approach much thought.</p>

<p>It recognises that an application may use more than one schema; for example in a pipeline using multiple stylesheets, it must be possible for the first stylesheet to produce valid output that is valid input to the second, without requiring that the two stylesheet have absolutely identical schema imports. It recognises that there are cases (for example involving substitution groups) where two schemas X and Y may both include the same type T, but produce different results when an element is validated against T. So it defines a concept of schema compatibility and defines its limitations, especially on the semantics of item types such as <code>element(*,T)</code> and <code>schema-element(E)</code>. The rules for schema compatibility between different modules of a query and between different packages in a stylesheet are tightened up and brought into line with each other.</p>

<p>I’m convinced that the function has been requested often enough to justify its inclusion in the spec. I’m also aware that users may have different expectations regarding the details of the conversion rules. On the other hand, this discussion can be observed for other languages as well, and that’s mostly due to the… heterogeneous history of URIs, not the actual implementations. For example, <code>URLDecode.decode</code> in Java converts the plus character to a space, and JavaScript’s <code>decodeURI</code> adopts it unchanged. I decided to convert it as well, as <code>fn:encode-for-uri</code> encodes the plus sign to <code>%2B</code>.</p>
<p>@ndw My rules have largely been inspired by your decoding rules for <code>fn:parse-uri</code>. I hope these rules can be dropped and replaced with a reference to this new function (analogous to <code>fn:build-uri</code>, which references <code>fn:encode-for-uri</code>).</p>

<p>Since no implementors have objected to these tests, it seems likely that implementations are delivering results in "order of first appearance", and if that is the case, then I think it would be a convenience to users to guarantee this in the spec.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Definition: Application functions are function definitions written in a host language such as XQuery or XSLT whose semantics are defined in this family of specifications. Their behavior (including the rules determining the static and dynamic context) follows the rules for such functions in the relevant host language specification.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first sentence appears to point to user-written functions in the host languages, and the second sentence appears to point to functions defined by the host language specifications. I assume that this category is meant to include both, and I propose the language be tightened up to make that clear. If my assumption is incorrect, then some other type of revision is needed.</p>
<p>Later on, when the term “built-in function” is introduced, it is not as clearly stated as it should be how that term maps onto the three-way division. It seems that “built-in function” encompasses all system functions and only those application functions that are defined by the specifications, and not user-written functions. Whatever the case, and whatever the best path of revision, this paragraph would be most effective if moved up with the tripartite category discussion.</p>
<p>The term "external function" is introduced here in the static context, with language that is highly suggestive of a definition. But the definition proper is reserved for the dynamic context, and in shorter, different prose that I think loses some of the considerations provided in the static context. I propose that the two passages be consolidated and located in the static context, where the two other types of functions are defined, with an xref in the dynamic context to the meaning of external function.</p>
<p>Down in the dynamic context:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The dynamically known function definitions may include external functions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sentence is a bit puzzling, because of course they are allowed to include all three types of functions -- none are forbidden, since, after all, the dynamically known functions are a superset of statically known ones. Perhaps the point is to drawn the reader's attention to those functions that are known dynamically but not statically? Perhaps this revision?: "Many of the function definitions known dynamically but not statically will be external functions, but they may include user-written application functions written in a host language, known only dynamically, e.g., through <code>fn:transform</code>."</p>
<p>Cumulatively the above points could go beyond mere minor touch-up, so comments are welcome before I attempt any edits.</p>

<p>I propose that when declaring a named record type in the static context, this should automatically create a constructor function definition for records of that type.</p>
<p>So in XQuery if you write</p>
<p><code>declare item type my:location as record(longitude: xs:double, latitude: xs:double);</code></p>
<p>then the static context acquires both a type (<code>let $loc as my:location := ....</code>) and a function which you can call with either positional or keyword arguments (<code>let $loc := my:position(-2.03, 50.95)</code> or <code>:= my:position(longitude := -2.03, latitude := 50.95)</code>.</p>
<p>The semantics of the function are roughly <code>map{longitude: -2.03, latitude: 50.95} treat as my:position</code>, except that the function arguments are first coerced to the required types (in this case the decimals are coerced to double).</p>
<p>If the record type is extensible, the constructor function does not provide any capability to set values for extension fields. I'm not sure yet whether it will be possible to distinguish fields set to an empty sequence from fields that are absent.</p>
<p>This is consistent with user-defined atomic types where you automatically get a constructor function.</p>
<p>Similarly for named union types. If you declare</p>
<p><code>declare item type my:binary as union(xs:hexBinary, xs:base64Binary)</code></p>
<p>then you should automatically get an arity-1 constructor function <code>my:binary($value)</code> with the same semantics as if <code>my:binary</code> were an XSD-defined union type (that is, the same semantics as <code>cast $value as union(xs:hexBinary, xs:base64Binary)</code>.</p>

<p>Currently the XDM specs have a predilection for Attribute Node, Element Node, Comment Node, Document Node, Text Node, Processing Instruction Node, Namespace Node. But in a healthy minority of cases in the XDM specs, they are rendered lowercase.</p>
<p>To complicate matters further, the other specs, which rely upon the XDM specs for the definition of the terms, universally prefer the lowercase form, and they use the terms preponderantly more. A healthy sample of four of the terms across five of the specifications ("elective" excludes instances where that particular case is required, e.g., capitalization in headers):</p>
<p>Term | Spec | Capitalized | Electively Capitalized | Electively Noncapitalized
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
Attribute node | XDM | 71 | 41 | 18
Element node | XDM | 79 | 71 | 23
Comment node | XDM | 44 | 39 | 0
Document node | XDM | 55 | 48 | 10
Attribute node | Serialization | 0 | 0 | 15
Element node | Serialization | 0 | 0 | 39
Comment node | Serialization | 0 | 0 | 2
Document node | Serialization | 0 | 0 | 15
Attribute node | XQuery | 1 | 0 | 82
Element node | XQuery | 0 | 0 | 141
Comment node | XQuery | 0 | 0 | 9
Document node | XQuery | 2 | 0 | 50
Attribute node | XFO | 1 | 0 | 28
Element node | XFO | 1 | 0 | 67
Comment node | XFO | 1 | 0 | 4
Document node | XFO | 1 | 0 | 57
Attribute node | XSLT | 8 | 0 | 100
Element node | XSLT | 16 | 0 | 77
Comment node | XSLT | 1 | 0 | 6
Document node | XSLT | 12 | 0 | 144</p>
<p>Options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do nothing.</li>
<li>Change all specs to capitalize these terms universally.</li>
<li>Change only XDM to capitalize these terms universally.</li>
<li>Determine a principle that would differentiate the contexts in which the term should be capitalized or not within XDM only.</li>
<li>Change all specs to uncapitalize these terms universally.</li>
</ol>
<p>My personal preference is no. 5. I do not see any passages in XDM where the reader would be confused by the term being uncapitalized (the minority cases being witnesses). Lowercase would bring XDM into conformity with the other specifications, and with how the term is commonly used outside the specs. Further, the XDM specs do not capitalize other terms it specially defines, e.g., accessor. And in all the specs, including XDM, the clear preference is to use the lowercase for the names in the raw (i.e., without "node"): element, attribute, namespace, etc.</p>
<p>I wanted to bring this to the group before doing any edits. I am happy to do the work, but do not want to do it if it is unwelcome, or if there is a clear preference for another option.</p>

<p>My feedback has been triggered by #607. I’ve moved various code examples into <code>eg</code> blocks. In principle, the result is promising, but it produces cases such as the following one (see https://qt4cg.org/pr/607/xpath-functions-40/Overview.html):</p>
<img src="https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/assets/196589/d64fd37a-2918-487c-967c-08570208d6c8" width="500">
<p>Maybe the result is better to read if single-line and multi-line monospace is formatted identically (i.e., without lines at the top and bottom, and with a transparent background)?</p>
<p>Next, it would be fine if we could get rid of the scrollbars. Often, it’s not apparent from the rendering that the presentation includes results at all:</p>
<img src="https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/assets/196589/b86d688b-fbdc-4a54-bd22-fa47e027dec2" width="500">
<p>We could possibly fix it by wrapping even more examples manually. That can be challenging, though, for example if long strings are used (such as <code>"http://www.w3.org/2013/collation/UCA?lang=en;alternate=blanked;strength=primary"</code>).</p>
<p>Finally, the formatting on mobile devices (here: an Android tablet with a Chrome renderer) differs from the desktop view: code blocks are rendered much smaller than the rest. – That’s just to mention it; I’d probably be annoyed if I was tasked with fixing that.</p>

However, the alternative, pure <em>dynamic typing</em>, prevents a processor reporting many obvious errors at compile time. A compromise is <em>optimistic static typing</em>, where the processor is allowed to report a type error statically in the cases where it can be shown that evaluation of an expression is bound to fail at run-time.</p>
<p>Optimistic static typing has proved a reasonably successful compromise, but there are a number of cases where things that are obviously user mistakes cannot be reported as static errors.  I propose that a processor should be allowed (not required) to treat some of these conditions as static errors.</p>
<p>The first of these conditions is exemplified by passing an argument whose static type is <code>xs:integer*</code> to a function where the declared parameter type is <code>xs:string*</code>. Under optimistic static typing this cannot be reported as a static error, because it is not bound to fail; if the actual value at run-time turns out to be an empty sequence, the call will succeed. So the proposal is that where the inferred supplied type and the required sequence types are both emptiable (that is, occurrence indicator is "?" or "*"), but their respective item types are disjoint, the processor should be allowed to report a static error.</p>
<p>The second condition is what I call a <em>void path expression</em>. Specifically, if we know statically that the result of <code>$A/B</code>, or <code>$A!B</code>, or <code>$A?B</code> will be an empty sequence for any possible value of $A (given its inferred type), this almost certainly means the user has made a mistake, and we should be allowed to report a static error. This extends to the unary or implicit forms of these operators, based on the inferred type of the context item. This is most likely to occur with schema-aware code, where it should be possible to report a path such as A/B/C/D as incorrect if the schema does not allow such a path. But it also arises for example for <code>$A?B</code> if the inferred type of $A is a non-extensible record type and B is not one of its known fields; and it arises for inappropriate combinations of axes such as <code>@code/text()</code>.</p>
<p>Note that I'm not proposing (as XQuery 1.0 static typing did) that <em>any</em> expression whose result is bound to be empty is a static error; the rule is confined to a few specific operators.</p>
<p>Perhaps, for backwards compatibility and interoperability, we should require processors to provide an option to switch this kind of static error detection off. (For example, XSLT 1.0 code sometimes deliberately uses <code>/..</code> to represent an empty sequence, and this construct would be flagged under these rules.)</p>

Maybe we should still think about adding a <code>fn:decode-uri</code> or <code>fn:decode-from-uri</code> function, in which we could tackle the open issues that need to be solved for <code>fn:parse-uri</code>. The current URI decoding rules could then be replaced with a reference to this new function.</p>

<p>This is a continuation of ideas raised in issue #341, issue #350, and elsewhere. It's related to the requirements presented in issue #262 and issue #297.</p>
<p>I have also presented ideas on transforming JSON trees at XML Prague and at Balisage, and I have tried out ideas over the years in Saxon extension functions. The proposal here owes a lot to those ideas, but consolidates them in a slightly different way.</p>
<p>I'll use the term JTree to refer to a tree structure of maps and arrays. The key difference between a JTree and a node tree (let's call it an XTree) is that the nodes in a JTree have no identity and no parent pointers.</p>
<p>As a result, some operations are remarkably difficult. Let's take one example:</p>
<p>Consider the JSON structure</p>
<pre><code>{ "cities": [
    {  "name" : "Paris",
       "size" : 300
    },
    {  "name" : "Berlin",
       "size" : 300
    }
]}
</code></pre>
<p>and suppose we want to return a modified version of this in which the size of Berlin is changed to 400. It would be nice to be able to write something like:</p>
<pre><code>modify($input, $input?cities[?name="Berlin"]?size, 400)
</code></pre>
<p>But of course, we can't do this. The result of the second argument is simply a number, 300, and we don't want to change all instances of the number 300 to 400, we only want to change one specific instance. Without value identity, the concept of "one specific instance" has no meaning.</p>
<p>I'll leave it as an exercise to the reader to work out how to do this transformation using our current XSLT and XQuery capabilities. It's far more difficult than it should be. In addition, the tree-walking approach in XSLT of applying template rules recursively is inefficient, because its cost typically depends on the size of the tree, not on the size of the modification. With immutable/persistent data structures underpinning XDM maps and arrays, it should be possible to perform this modification in constant time, regardless of the size of the tree.</p>
<p>My solution to this is that the expression in the second argument should return a <em>pinned value</em>. The pinned value behaves just like a plain integer 300 when used in operations such as arithmetic, but being pinned means that its location in the original JTree is retained, meaning that it becomes possible to replace it in the JTree with a different value.</p>
<h2>Data Model</h2>
<p>We need a change to the data model. Any value (any item or sequence) can have the property of being <em>pinned</em>. If a value is pinned, then it has a property called its <em>locus</em> which identifies its position within a JTree.</p>
<p>With a small number of exceptions, specifically noted below, the fact that a value is pinned and has a locus does not change the effect of any operations on the value. For example, the fact that an integer with value 300 is pinned does not change the result of any arithmetic or comparison operations on the number.</p>
<p>A <em>locus</em> may identify a value as being the root of a JTree, or it may identify its position within a JTree. In the latter case it has two basic properties called its <em>container</em> and its <em>slot</em>. The container is a pinned sequence, array, or map, and the slot identifies the value's position within the container: if the container is a sequence or an array, then the slot is an integer position; if the container is a map, then the slot is a key value.</p>
<h2>Operations on Pinned Values</h2>
<p>A value (any value) can be pinned as the root of a JTree using the function <code>fn:pin(value)</code>. This returns a value that is in every way identical to the original (including node identity, if it is a node or contains nodes) except for being pinned.</p>
<p>Some selected operations have their definition changed so that if the input is a pinned value, then the result is a pinned value. These are of two kinds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operations that return an existing value unchanged generally retain the pinned property and the locus. For example if a value is bound to a variable, then the result of a variable reference will retain these properties.</li>
<li>Operations that select a value within a sequence, array, or map, when that sequence, array, or map is pinned, return a pinned value whose locus identifies the container and the value's slot within that container.</li>
</ul>
<p>So in the above example, if <code>$input</code> is pinned, the expression <code>$input?cities[?name="Berlin"]?size</code> returns an integer (300) whose locus is <code>(C, "size")</code>, where C is the map having name="Berlin". C in turn has a locus (A, 2) where A is the array of cities, and A has a locus (R, "cities") where R is the root of the JTree (the original <code>$input</code> value).</p>
<p>It now becomes possible to define the <code>modify</code> function as follows: The first argument is a value which must be pinned. The second argument must return a pinned value which must be within the tree identified by the first argument (that is, recursively finding the container must lead to this root). The result of the <code>modify()</code> function is formed by recursively replacing each container, all the way up to the root, with a new container in which the contents of the relevant slot are replaced.</p>
<h2>Feasibility</h2>
<p>Let's pause to ask ourselves two questions: is this reasonably feasible to implement, and is it realistically possible to expect users to understand what's going on?</p>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>I've had an implementation of something rather similar in Saxon for years, and I don't think it's especially difficult. In effect we have a Java class <code>PinnedValue</code> which extends <code>Value</code> and which delegates nearly all operations (including "instance of") to a contained <code>Value</code>. The one thing you need to be careful of is assuming (for example) that if a value represents an XDM array, then it will be an instance of a Java class such as <code>XdmArray</code>. (The terminology in the current Saxon implementation is quite different, so don't expect to find this in the current code).</p>
<h3>Usability</h3>
<p>I think that basic features like the <code>modify()</code> function won't be too difficult to explain. We just have to explain that (a) you can only modify a JTree if the root is first pinned, and (b) the expression used in the second argument must use a restricted set of operations: basically, those that do downward selection of values within a container.</p>
<h2>Further Operations</h2>
<p>I've illustrated the benefits with one particular operation, a modify() function, but the feature opens up many other possibilities as well. Here are a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>For pinned values we can expose the container and slot properties through functions (or through custom syntax such as axes). For example this means that in XSLT, if you are doing a recursive traversal of a JTree, a template rule for processing a particular value has access to its ancestors in the same way as is possible for XTrees.</li>
<li>In addition derived properties of a pinned value can be exposed, for example the preceding and following "siblings" within an array (or indeed, within a sequence).</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll explore some additional use cases in further posts.</p>

<p>The effect of the attribute <code>xsl:sort/@order</code> is never explained in the text; it is assumed that the meaning is obvious.</p>
<p>The only explicit statement that the default is "ascending" is in the schema-for-xslt40, which is non-normative.</p>
<p>The schema also gives a default of "text" for the data-type attribute, which is incorrect: when data-type is set to text, values will be cast to string before comparison, which is not what happens if the actual sort key values are numeric.</p>
<p>We have added prose to define what we mean by "effective value". This clarifies that the effective value of the order attribute, if omitted, is the default value. But we don't have a systematic and formal way of saying what the default value is. This affects the result of test merge-021, which depends on deciding whether the two xsl:merge-source elements have the same effective value for "order", when one is omitted and the other is set to "ascending".</p>

<ol>
<li>array:replace would be more versatile if multiple positions could be specified, rather than just a single position.</li>
<li>if all positions are selected, the function becomes identical to array:for-each. So perhaps we should scrap array:replace and instead add an optional parameter <code>$positions as xs:integer*</code> to array:for-each. However, that could be confusing: people might imagine that the items at positions not present in the list are discarded, rather than being returned unchanged in the result. So I propose we don't do that.</li>
<li>if the function is useful on arrays, then it's also useful on sequences. But <code>fn:replace</code> does something completely different.</li>
<li>We have a similar function on maps called <code>map:substitute</code> (but it's not quite the same, because it processes every entry in the map).</li>
</ol>
<p>In the interests of alignment, I propose we have three functions:</p>
<p><code>fn:substitute($input as item()*, $positions as xs:positiveInteger*, $action as function(item()) as item())</code></p>
<p>equivalent to <code>for $it at $pos in $item return if ($pos = $positions) then $action($it) else $it</code></p>
<p><code>array:substitute($array as array(*), $positions as xs:positiveInteger*, $action as function(item()*) as item()*)</code></p>
<p>equivalent to <code>array{for member $it at $pos in $item return if ($pos = $positions) then $action($it) else $it}</code></p>
<p><code>map:substitute($map as map(*), $keys as xs:anyAtomicValue*, $action as function(anyAtomicValue, item()*) as item()*)</code></p>
<p>For the first two functions, we don't really need to allow the second argument to be omitted, because it would then be equivalent to the corresponding for-each() function. Unfortunately that's not quite true of map:for-each(), because it doesn't return a map. However if you want to do a functional replacement of every entry in a map, it can be done easily enough with</p>
<p><code>map:build(map:key-value-pairs($map), function{?key}, function{$action(?value)})</code></p>
<p>so we're not really losing anything.</p>

<p>Firstly, the results should be the same when the input consists entirely of atomic values, or sequences, maps, and arrays consisting entirely of atomic values. This only requires one change: serializing a sequence of length &gt;1 should output the sequence as if it were an array, rather than raising an error. This is a compatible change.</p>
<p>Secondly, the new fn:items-to-json() function should have an option to output elements (for example elements appearing within maps or arrays) in the same way as the JSON serialization method does, by serializing the nodes to lexical XML or HTML contained within a JSON character string.</p>
<p>Finally, we should align the rules on how to output a function item (other than a map or array). We could either adopt the serialization approach (raise an error), or the items-to-json() approach (output some kind of placeholder saying "here be dragons") but they should be aligned.</p>
<p>Note that the two operations are still very different. items-to-json() is primarily about converting XML to JSON, while JSON serialization is primarily about turning maps and arrays into their JSON lexical form.</p>

<h3>Signature</h3>
<pre><code>fn:dump(
  $value  as item()*,	
  $label  as xs:string?  := ()
) as empty-sequence()
</code></pre>
<h3>Properties</h3>
<p>This function is ·deterministic·, ·context-independent·, and ·focus-independent·.</p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>Similar to <code>fn:trace:</code>, the values of <code>$value</code>, converted to an <code>xs:string</code>, and <code>$label</code> (if supplied and non-empty) may be directed to a trace data set. The destination of the trace output is ·implementation-defined·. The format of the trace output is ·implementation-dependent·, as is the ordering of the output.</p>
<p>In contrast to <code>fn:trace</code>, the function returns an empty sequence.</p>

The basic functions are</p>
<pre><code>new-document($children as node()*)
new-element($name as QName, $content as node()*)
new-attribute($name as QName, $value as xs:string)
new-namespace($prefix as xs:string, $uri as xs:string)
new-comment($content as xs:string)
new-processing-instruction($name as xs:string, $content as xs:string)
new-text($content as xs:string)
</code></pre>
<p>The semantics would be essentially identical to the current node constructors in XQuery and/or the corresponding instructions in XSLT (there are very few differences: a few minor ones, like if there are multiple attributes with the same name, XSLT takes the last, while XQuery throws an error).</p>
<p>As always, it's difficult to know where to draw the line in functionality between XPath and XQuery. One of the guidelines I use is that if an addition to XPath is likely to be useful to XSLT users, then it's worth including. Clearly these functions are not strictly necessary in XSLT (they could easily be user-supplied as wrappers around XSLT instructions). But to take advantage of some of the other capabilities we're introducing in XPath, node construction functions are increasingly handy. Consider for example:</p>
<p><code>&lt;xsl:copy-of select="interleave(para, new-element(xs:QName(xhtml:br)))"/&gt;</code></p>
<p>That's a one-liner that replaces</p>
<pre><code>&lt;xsl:for-each select="para"&gt;
  &lt;xsl:if test="position() ne 1"&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/xsl:if&gt;
  &lt;xsl:copy-of select="."/&gt;
&lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The new functions are also useful in XQuery because although they duplicate existing syntax, the fact that they are functions rather than custom syntax makes them more versatile.</p>
<p>As with existing constructs in XQuery and XSLT, a naive implementation that follows the semantics literally (which involves copying a subtree when adding an element to a new parent) would be rather inefficient. However, I think that the same established optimizations are equally applicable, for example lazy tree construction and/or push-mode evaluation.</p>

But there is no way of doing this in XQuery.</p>
<p>It was done as an instruction in XSLT because functions at the time were not flexible enough to cope with a range of optional parameters. This situation has changed.</p>
<p>An <code>fn:evaluate()</code> function might operate successfully with the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>xpath - the XPath expression as a string.</li>
<li>namespaces - the namespace bindings as a map from prefix to URI, defaulting to the namespace bindings in the static context of the caller</li>
<li>parameters - parameter values as a map from QName to value, defaulting to an empty map</li>
<li>context-item - the context item for evaluation, defaulting to the context item of the caller</li>
<li>options:
<ul>
<li>default collation</li>
<li>base URI</li>
<li>schema-aware = true/false</li>
<li>allow-external-access = true/false</li>
<li>cache = true/false (whether to cache compiled expressions for reuse)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Before <code>xsl:evaluate</code> as introduced, there was some concern in the WG about security and the risk of injection attacks. I think that the allow-external-access switch is sufficient for this: if you don't trust the expression, set it to false, and all dangerous things like access to external documents and other resources, use of extension functions, etc, is disabled.</p>

The errata can be found in the repository at https://github.com/w3c/qtspecs/blob/master/errata/xslt-30/errata.xml but they are not published or linked from the spec; they were produced by the XSL WG after publishing 3.0 and before the group disbanded.</p>
<p>The version of the schema found in the 3.0 repository does not include these corrections; therefore, neither does the one in the 4.0 repository.</p>
<p>There is another version of the schema in the xslt30test repository, and this one does include the corrections (as far as I can see).</p>
<p>However, new additions for changes needed for 4.0 have been applied inconsistently to the two versions.</p>
<p>There's therefore a pressing need to bring everything back into line. A good step would be to cut out the duplication: once we've got it clean, the build process should copy qtspecs/specifications/xslt-40/src/schema-for-xslt40.xsd to xslt40-test/tests/misc/catalog/schema-for-xslt40.xsd and we should only maintain the former.</p>

When working with binary types currently one has to fall back to string conversions and/or extensions.
A few ideas on nice to have functions that operate on binary types:
-accessing a single byte at a specific position
-splitting binary data at byte boundary (aka binary-subsequence)
-converting to/from a sequence of byte(s)
-joining binary data together
-(optionally) loading data directly as (base64)binary (some extensions are using unparsed-text with proprietary decoding 'x-binarytobase64' to retrieve a base64 castable string)
-standard bit-wise operators and, or, xor, not, rshift, lshift</p>
<p>If considered, then each needs to be discussed in detail separately -ex. which type to support signed/unsigned, 8 bit etc.-, I merely intend as conversation starter in case others encountered similar issues/limitations.</p>
<p><em>p.s.: Not sure if this is the right channel to raise this issue, so feel free to close/move/split accordingly.</em></p>

<p>What is a stream of Unicode characters? AFAIK, Unicode characters cannot be streamed <em>an sich</em> but require some encoding. And how does would such a stream not consist of bytes/octets of one sort or another? A stream of what exactly?</p>

<p>I initially reopened <strong><a href="https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/518">the original issue</a></strong>, because there is some useful and needed functionality that the PR and the text of the FO specification do not provide, and we missed to discuss this at the June 13th meeting.</p>
<p><strong>I believe that typically a developer would need to know if the "whole" TC was completely produced, or not, and maybe how many iterations were needed</strong>.</p>
<p>This can be provided if the result of the function was for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xq">map{ 
        "TC" : $thefinalTCNodeset,
        "WasTCComplete": $boolForTCCompletion,
        "NumberOfIterations: $someInteger
       }
</code></pre>
<p>One could argue that if <strong><em><code>$result? NumberOfIterations &lt; max</code></em></strong>, then we know that the complete TC was produced and thus we don't need the member "WasTCComplete".</p>
<p>However, this is not the case when <strong><em><code>$result? NumberOfIterations eq max</code></em></strong>. In this case both outcomes are possible: the complete TC was produced exactly in <code>max</code> iterations (so the value of <code>"WasTCComplete"</code>  must be <code>true()</code> ), or <code>max</code> iterations were performed and the <code>max + 1</code>st iteration produced additional nodes -- in this case <code>"WasTCComplete"</code> must be <code>false()</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Failure to produce the complete TC in many cases will be regarded as error, and the developer needs to be sure that this was (or this wasn't) the case</strong>.</p>
<p>thus, the current specification of this function needs additional work to accomodate the full needed functionality.</p>

<p>The draft specification for fn:differences was added to the spec before we had a review process in place. The spec is complex and incomplete; issue #316 points out some of the difficulties. This PR removes it from the spec.</p>
<p>Note that fn:deep-equal() now has a debug option which outputs diagnostic information in implementation-defined format; although not interoperable, this meets the main use case, which is to discover for diagnostic purposes why and in what way two values are not deep-equal to each other.</p>

<p>Not only is this a very easy trap to fall into, it also tends to result in poor diagnostics because we're in lookahead territory where we are also considering an alternative parse along the lines <code>$a- &gt; EXPR</code> (where the variable name is <code>a-</code>), and this parse only gets disqualified because an expression can't begin with <code>{</code>.</p>
<p>If we later introduce expressions that start with <code>{</code>, writing <code>$a-&gt;{3}</code> with no space would no longer be an error, it would just mean something completely different from what you intended.</p>
<p>One solution, not a very pretty one, is to require parentheses around the argument list even when there is only a single argument. Almost as inconvenient as requiring the space, but with better diagnostics if you forget.</p>
<p>Another solution might be to restrict the parameter name so it can't contain a hyphen. The problem with that is that the tokenization becomes sensitive to the grammatical context, which is not totally unexplored territory, but complicates the fact that we're already in lookahead territory where we are looking at alternative parses. (The Saxon implementation already does the lookahead by retokenizing, so it's not impossible.)</p>
<p>Would it be too horrendous to contemplate a backwards-incompatible change to say variable names cannot end in a hyphen, anywhere? Perhaps with a mode bit for compatibility? After all, all this complication is caused by the need to cater for something which no sane user ever does.</p>

The intention is to reduce clutter and to improve the readability where code samples (either expressions or results) need multi-line rendition.</p>
<p>In the vast majority of cases the change is clearly (IMHO) an improvement, but further tweaking is possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>There may be scope for tailoring the CSS (for example, I don't like the fact that table cells are centred vertically).</li>
<li>Some of the tables (e.g. parse-uri examples) take too much horizontal space; the code should be edited to reduce the line length</li>
<li>Examples are sometimes introduced with a free-standing paragraph tag rather than with fo:preamble, which separates the introduction from the code into a separate table row.</li>
<li>Some of the examples that were designed for inline rendition could usefully take advantage of the opportunity to turn them into multi-line code samples.</li>

<p>I've tried to cover off most of what was discussed in that issue, but I have avoided dealing with backlash escapes (per @ChristianGruen's early comment), sticking with the RFC 4180 quoting approach.</p>
<p>There are some issues with the structure where I tried to follow the existing structure of chapter 15, but that leaves the function definition in 15.4 separated by a lot of text before the wider format discussion in 15.7. The split between function def and context affects the JSON and HTML parsing functions too, so I have avoided trying to fix that as well in this PR.</p>
<p>If this meets with approval, I'll squash commits and rebase before merging.</p>

<p>The rationale for doing it is discussed at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1580647/json-why-are-forward-slashes-escaped</p>
<p>The short summary is that it's only needed when JSON is inserted into an HTML <code>script</code> element, and then only when immediately followed by <code>&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>There's a workaround using character maps but it's really clumsy.</p>
<p>I don't want to escape forward slashes by default in the xdm-to-json() function because they appear so often in namespaces and it adds an awful lot of visual clutter. That means that our JSON formatter needs an option to suppress this escaping, which means we might as well provide user control over it as an output property...</p>
<p>Adding a new output property just for this purpose is rather heavyweight both in the specs and in our implementation, but I can't think of a better solution. So I propose adding <code>escape-solidus</code>, values yes/no, default (for compatibility) yes.</p>
<p>Yes, someone will ask about the name. Surely no-one calls it a solidus? Well, Unicode does, and I think we should use the official name. And it avoids arguing about whether it should be slash or forwards-slash or forward-slash. At least I'm not proposing virgule.</p>

<ol>
<li>I think a better name for the function might be <code>fn:to-json</code>. Any other suggestions?</li>
<li>Where we specify that a JSON object should be output with particular properties, I think we should be consistent about whether or not we prescribe the order. Writing tests is a lot easier if the order is always prescribed!</li>
<li>Document nodes: it would be better to output both the document URI and the base URI where available.</li>
<li>Under "The children of the element are processed as follows" there are four rules. In the case where an element has just one element node child, I think rule 4 should apply rather than rule 3.</li>
<li>Under Processing-Instruction nodes: typo "A JSON object with a two properties".</li>
<li>The section starting "Strings are escaped as follows" should be promoted up a level.</li>
<li>Representing functions: I propose a different set of rules. (a) for a function that is a reference to a built-in or user-defined function definition, output "Q{uri}local#arity". (b) for an anonymous function, output "#anonymous-function". The rationale is that the JSON output here isn't going to be useful except as a placeholder to indicate that a function item is present.</li>
<li>We might want to be more prescriptive about how numbers are formatted (or to provide user options)</li>
<li>Like many XML-to-JSON libraries, there's the problem that two instances of the same element type might be output very differently depending on which children are present. For example the representation of a book with two authors might be very different from a book with one author. I would suggest that rather than the boolean <code>element-map</code> option, we allow the options to include a list of element names for which <code>object</code> representation rather than <code>array</code> representation is to be used.</li>

<p>Because the returned map contains function items, which always have a fixed arity, I think it needs to contain one entry for each arity in the arity range. This involves evaluating the defaults for any parameters that have a default value defined; if the default value is context dependent, this is going to have to use the context of the <code>load-xquery-module()</code> function call, which isn't very meaningful, but I can't see what else to do.</p>
<p>An alternative is to only include one function item in the result, corresponding to the maximum arity.</p>
<p>If we introduce sequence-variadic functions, the arity range becomes infinite, which makes both of these ideas problematic. But presumably sequence-variadic functions will be callable with all the values supplied in a single array?</p>

<p>issue #520 - function identity
issue #333 - equality of function items
issue #381 - deep-equal comparison without errors</p>
<p>The PR introduces a concept of function identity in the data model, and for all expressions that create functions, explains what the identity of the returned function is.</p>
<p>The concept of function identity is used initially in two places: in fn:deep-equal(), when the operands include function items; and in the F+O prose defining the concept of determinism, which in turn is relied on by the definition of memo functions in XSLT.</p>
<p>I had hoped to go further and address issue #119, generalising what kinds of values are allowed as keys in maps, but as explained in a comment on that issue, I hit obstacles.</p>

<p>We change the data model for functions so that functions, like nodes, have an identity that is acquired when the function is created; two functions are identical if and only if they have the same identity.</p>
<p>In general any expression that returns a new function allocates it an identity that is different from all other existing functions (as with nodes). However:</p>

<li>Repeated evaluation of a function reference such as count#1 returns the same function each time, provided that the target function is context-free.</li>
<li>Optimizers are allowed to rewrite expressions (for example by loop-lifting, etc) so that expressions that would in principle return distinct functions actually return the same function, provided the optimizer can determine that the two functions are equivalent in all respects other than their identity. For example if the expression <code>contains(?, 'xxx')</code> appears in a loop, the expression can be lifted out of the loop so there is no requirement that it returns different functions each time (as there is with nodes)</li>
</ul>
<p>Benefits of this approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>identical($x, $x) is always true (function identity survives binding to variables)</li>
<li>functions obtained by repeated evaluation of the same expression in the same context are likely to return identical results in cases that are simple enough for an optimizer to analyse</li>
<li>the results are likely to be reasonably intuitive</li>
<li>optimisers aren't constrained by rules on identity to restrict the rewrites they can attempt</li>
</ul>
<p>This does mean that expressions that return functions become a little impure - but only in the same way that expressions that create nodes are a little impure. The impurity is well understood and tolerated.</p>
<p>Maps and arrays do not have identity as a property separate from their content.</p>

<ul>
<li>The problem mentioned in issue 237, namely the lack of clarity in the "longest token rule". This PR fixes this by clarifying what this rule means and where it applies. In particular it tackles the issue of "complex terminals" such as element constructor expressions and string templates where a symbol that is a single token at one level (in the sense that whitespace is constrained) also contains enclosed expressions.</li>
<li>Some productions/tokens were misclassified or omitted from the relevant lists of tokens in the appendix. This has been fixed in part by using general rules in the grammar2spec stylesheet to generate lists of tokens, rather than relying on annotations in the grammar file.</li>

<p>As per Wikipedia:</p>
<p>" In&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics">mathematics</a>,&nbsp;<strong>function composition</strong>&nbsp;is an operation&nbsp; ∘ &nbsp;that takes two&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)">functions</a>&nbsp;<em>f</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>g</em>, and produces a function&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>h</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em>g</em>&nbsp; ∘  <em>f</em>&nbsp;such that&nbsp;<em>h</em>(<em>x</em>) =&nbsp;<em>g</em>(<em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)).</p>
<p>In this operation, the function&nbsp;<em>g</em>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_application">applied</a>&nbsp;to the result of applying the function&nbsp;<em>f</em>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em>x</em>. That is, the functions&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>f</em> :&nbsp;<em>X</em>&nbsp;→&nbsp;<em>Y</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>g</em> :&nbsp;<em>Y</em>&nbsp;→&nbsp;<em>Z</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>are&nbsp;<strong>composed</strong>&nbsp;to yield a function that maps&nbsp;<em>x</em>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_a_function">domain</a>&nbsp;<em>X</em>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em>g</em>(<em>f</em>(<em>x</em>))&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codomain">codomain</a>&nbsp;<em>Z</em>.</p>
<p>Intuitively, if&nbsp;<em>z</em>&nbsp;is a function of&nbsp;<em>y</em>, and&nbsp;<em>y</em>&nbsp;is a function of&nbsp;<em>x</em>, then&nbsp;<em>z</em>&nbsp;is a function of&nbsp;<em>x</em>.</p>

"</p>
<hr>
<p>In this Proposal we generalize function composition to the case when a sequence of functions are composed together, so that the last one is applied on an argument $x, then  the last-but-one is applied on the result of this application, and so on … until finally the first function in the sequence is applied on the result produced so far.</p>
<p>This is an effective way of chaining a sequence of functions together, and we don’t need to invent or use any special operators or syntax, but we just pass this sequence of functions as argument to <strong><em>fn:multi-compose</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>fn:multi-compose := function($funs as function(*)*, $x)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Here is an XPath 3.0 implementation of fn:multi-compose</strong>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xq">let $apply := function($f, $x) {fn:apply($f, [$x])},
    $multi-compose := function($funs as function(*)*, $x)
                  {
                    fold-right($funs, $x, $apply)
                  },
    (: The functions $incr and $times are needed just to show this example :) 
    $incr := function($x) {op("+")(?, $x)},
    $times := function($y) {op("*")(?, $y)}                 
                  
 return
   $multi-compose(($times(5), $incr(1)), 2)
</code></pre>
<p>As wanted, the result of evaluating this is</p>
<p>15: (2 +1) * 5</p>
<h2>Remarks</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In this implementation the type of the 2nd (last) argument of <strong><em>$multi-compose</em></strong> and <strong><em>$apply</em></strong> is <code>item()*</code> (any) and as such it is omitted. In case the function to be applied first, needs  more than one argument, all of its arguments must be presented in the function call as a single sequence , and are passed (in order) as the members of a single array, as already implemented by the standard <strong><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions-31/#func-apply">fn:apply</a></strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a dynamic error if any of the function applications produces a result which does not belong to the Domain of the function immediately preceding it in the function sequence.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>One of the intended use cases for this was to allow existing higher-order functions to be extended while retaining backwards compatibility. For example, in <code>fn:filter</code>, we can change the required type of the predicate function from <code>function(item()) as xs:boolean</code> to <code>function(item(), xs:positiveInteger) as xs:boolean</code>, with the second argument supplying the position of the item being tested. A function that isn't interested in the position can just ignore it, so existing calls will continue to work.</p>
<p>I propose that we add a position argument to the callbacks for:</p>
<pre><code>fn:filter
fn:for-each
fn:for-each-pair
fn:partition
fn:items-after
fn:items-before
fn:items-starting-where
fn:items-ending-where
array:filter
array:for-each
array:for-each-pair
</code></pre>
<p>Other candidates include</p>
<pre><code>fn:all
fn:some
fn:index-where
array:index-where
</code></pre>
<p>but I suggest we leave these unless someone can think of a use case.</p>

<p>In the current grammar rules, there are subtle differences in the <code>InlineFunctionExpr</code> and <code>LambdaExpr</code> rules that we should dissolve.</p>
<p>Annotations are not supported in lambda expressions, which I believe is an unnecessary restriction:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">(: currently legal :)
let $delete-texts := %updating function($nodes) { delete nodes $nodes//text() }
return $delete-texts(//city)

(: currently illegal :)
let $delete-texts := %updating ($nodes) -&gt; { delete nodes $nodes//text() }
return $delete-texts(//city)
</code></pre>
<p>It should suffice to extend one rule in the grammar:</p>
<pre><code>(: old :)
LambdaExpr  ::=  LambdaParams "-&gt;" EnclosedExpr
(: new :)
LambdaExpr  ::=  Annotation* LambdaParams "-&gt;" EnclosedExpr
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p>We could also type declarations (as @michaelhkay has indicated below, though, this might not be as simple to realize as I hoped):</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">(: currently legal :)
let $find-john := function($node as node()) as xs:boolean { contains($node, 'john') }
return $find-john($node)

(: currently illegal :)
let $find-john := ($node as node()) as xs:boolean -&gt; { contains($node, 'john') }
return $find-john($node)
</code></pre>
<p>The type declarations cannot be allowed if parentheses are omitted (unless we make them mandatory):</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">(: without parens :)
$i -&gt; { ... }

(: parens :)
($i as xs:int) as xs:int -&gt; { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>These are the current grammar rules:</p>
<pre><code>FunctionItemExpr    ::=  NamedFunctionRef | InlineFunctionExpr | LambdaExpr
InlineFunctionExpr  ::=  Annotation* "function" FunctionSignature FunctionBody
FunctionSignature   ::=  "(" ParamList? ")" TypeDeclaration?
ParamList           ::=  Param ("," Param)*
Param               ::=  "$" EQName TypeDeclaration?
FunctionBody        ::=  EnclosedExpr
LambdaExpr          ::=  LambdaParams "-&gt;" EnclosedExpr
LambdaParams        ::=  LambdaParam | "(" | (LambdaParam ("," LambdaParam)*)? | ")"
LambdaParam         ::=  "$" VarName
</code></pre>
<p>As the <code>InlineFunctionExpr</code> and <code>LambdaExpr</code> both generate anonymous functions, we shouldn’t make a difference, and this is what I would recommend:</p>
<pre><code>FunctionItemExpr    ::=  NamedFunctionRef | InlineFunctionExpr
InlineFunctionExpr  ::=  Annotation* (InlineFunction | LambdaFunction) FunctionBody
InlineFunction      ::=  "function" FunctionSignature
LambdaFunction      ::=  (Param | FunctionSignature)) "-&gt;"
FunctionSignature   ::=  "(" ParamList? ")" TypeDeclaration?
ParamList           ::=  TypedParam ("," TypedParam)*
TypedParam          ::=  Param TypeDeclaration?
Param               ::=  "$" VarName
</code></pre>
<p>Disclaimer: I could have raised this earlier, but I didn’t want to prolong the ongoing discussion on the open pull requests.</p>

<p>This could be changed by adding the <code>InlineFunctionExpr</code> to the <code>ArrowDynamicFunction</code> rule:</p>

[143]  PositionalArgumentList  ::=  "(" PositionalArguments? ")"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be best to tackle this after we’ve resolved #503, and we’ll have to check if the simplification doesn’t cause ambiguities.</p>

<p>To make this work, some refinement of the static and dynamic context definitions is needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>default collation is moved from the static context to the dynamic context, with a note that it is always known statically except in the case when defining the default for a function parameter.</li>
<li>static base URI (in the static context) and executable base URI (in the dynamic context) are now formally separated; previously we fudged this by saying they could be different, but without recognizing separate context components</li>

<h3>XQFO 4.0 Draft</h3>
<p>…provides new functions for singletons and map representations:</p>
<p>Maps | Singleton Maps | Pairs (Key-Value Pair Maps)
:--- | :--- | :---
Decompose | <strong><code>map:entries($map)</code></strong> | <strong><code>map:pairs($map)</code></strong>
Compose | <code>map:merge($maps)</code> | <strong><code>map:of($pairs)</code></strong>
Create single | <code>map:entry($key, $value)</code><br><code>map { $key: $value }</code> | –<br><strong><code>map { 'key': $key, 'value': $value }</code></strong>
Extract keys | <code>map:keys($map)</code> | <strong><code>$pairs?key</code></strong>
Extract values (flat) | <strong><code>map:values($map)</code></strong><br><code>$map?*</code> | <strong><code>$pairs?value</code></strong>
<strong>Arrays</strong> | <strong>Singleton Arrays</strong> | <strong>Members (Value Maps)</strong>
Decompose | – | <strong><code>array:members($array)</code></strong>
Compose | <code>array:join($arrays)</code> | <strong><code>array:of($members)</code></strong>
Create single | <code>[ $value ]</code> | <strong><code>array { 'value': $value }</code></strong>
Extract values (flat) | <strong><code>array:values($array)</code></strong> | <strong><code>$members?value</code></strong></p>
<p>The following terminology can be derived from the function names:</p>
<ul>
<li>A key-value pair map with a single map pair is called a <strong>Pair</strong>.</li>
<li>A value map with a single array member is called a <strong>Member</strong>.</li>
<li>A singleton map is called an <strong>Entry</strong> (due to <code>map:entry</code>)</li>
<li>We have no name for a singleton array.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Complete the Picture</h3>
<p>I believe we should:</p>
<ol>
<li>rename <code>map:of</code> to <code>map:of-pairs</code> or <code>map:merge-pairs</code> (as a hint that singletons are not the expected input)</li>
<li>rename <code>array:of</code> to <code>array:of-members</code> or <code>array:join-members</code> (as a hint…)</li>
<li>add <code>map:pair</code> for creating a single pair</li>
<li>add <code>array:split</code> (<code>array:tokenize</code>, …?) for decomposing arrays to singleton arrays</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m not sure if we should add array functions for creating singletons or value maps; we also have <code>array:build</code>.</p>

<p>The new status quo is that people have to write <code>sort(//emp, (), $e-&gt;{$e/@salary})</code> which feels clumsy in comparison.</p>
<p>This issue examines options for reinstating such a capability, and perhaps making it more powerful.</p>
<p>A reason for dropping the syntax was that it didn't play well with the "thin arrow" operator in pipelines, but we have now changed the symbol for that to <code>=!&gt;</code> so the objection no longer applies so strongly.</p>
<p>Ideally we want something that not only replaces focus functions (arity one arguments accepting an argument of type item()), but also meets some or all of the following additional requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Works well on the RHS of the <code>=&gt;</code> and <code>=!&gt;</code> operators, in a construct that we might write as <code>$list =!&gt; {.+1}()</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also allows arity-one functions whose argument is a sequence (<code>item()*</code>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This becomes a lot easier if we can solve issue #129 which generalises the context item to a context value. Let's assume we do that, and keep an open mind for the moment as to whether the generalized context value is referenced as <code>.</code> or <code>~</code>. I'll use <code>~</code> for now. So we want a compact notation for functions of arity one in which the function body refers to the argument value as <code>~</code>. For aesthetic reasons, because it's going to be used on the RHS of an arrow operator, we really don't want to introduce it with a leading arrow like the previous syntax <code>-&gt;{.+1}</code>. Use of "bare braces" (simply <code>{~+1}</code>) is very tempting, but I think there is a good argument for leaving that part of the syntactic space unused, for extensibility and for diagnostics. I think my preference is for <code>fn{~+1}</code>. Using a keyword (such as map, array, validate) before a braced expression is a uniform device and keeps the grammar coherent.</p>
<p>So in a callback such as fn:sort, we can write <code>sort(//emp, (), fn{@salary})</code>, and in a pipeline we can write <code>$list =!&gt; fn{.+1}()</code>. (To allow this, all we need to do is to generalise what's allowed as an <code>ArrowDynamicFunction</code>).</p>
<p>A separate question is whether we can (and should) allow the empty argument list to be omitted. I think I'm persuaded by the arguments that it's better to keep it, as a visual signal that the function is being applied, not just returned.</p>

<p>On closer inspection, there were only a few places where typographic quotes <em>were not</em> used in prose. I've fixed those. I think the DM spec could probably use an editorial pass to add <code>code</code> around some literals, but I'm not doing that in this PR.</p>
<p>I've left typographic quotes around code and literals because I don't think straight quotes would be an improvement: the literal <code>“&lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt;”</code> doesn't need straight quotes because the quotes are not part of the literal.</p>

<p>I will push a separate branch, <code>legacy-documentation</code>, to the repository that contains all of the the files removed by this PR so that the aren't lost and can easily be recovered. (I won't do that as a PR, I'll just push it to the repository.)</p>
<p>In the meantime, I think this trimmed down master branch works just fine and it's a lot simpler and easier to explain.</p>

<p>The spec gives this example (for json-to-xml):</p>
<pre><code>The expression json-to-xml('{"x": "\\", "y": "\u0025"}', map{'escape': true()}) returns 
(with whitespace added for legibility):

&lt;map xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions"&gt;
  &lt;string escaped="true" key="x"&gt;\\&lt;/string&gt;
  &lt;string key="y"&gt;%&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;/map&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>But the test we actually generate expects the result:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;map xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions"&gt;
    &lt;string escaped="true" key="x" escaped-key="false"&gt;\\&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;string key="y" escaped="false" escaped-key="false"&gt;%&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;/map&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>and the test is failing because the result produced by Saxon correctly excludes the <code>escaped-key="false"</code> attributes which the test is expecting. How did the attributes get there?</p>
<p>The answer is that the stylesheet is doing <code>parse-xml()</code> followed by some transformation to normalise whitespace, followed by <code>serialize()</code>. The <code>parse-xml()</code> call is invoking schema validation, which adds default attributes.</p>
<p>We probably don't want schema validation here; if we do want it, we probably don't want default attribute values to be expanded. But parse-xml() doesn't give us the choice. It says it's implementation-defined and it gives no options for the user to control it. Saxon provides configuration-level options but they aren't fine-grained enough to use here.</p>
<p>Without being able to control this, the only option seems to be for the stylesheet to transform the result to take out the defaulted attributes that the schema processor has added.</p>
<p>We need options on functions like <code>doc()</code> and <code>parse-xml()</code> to control whether and how schema validation is performed.</p>
<p>One of the options we need whenever we do validation is probably "validate+strip" - validate the input, report errors if it's invalid, but return the untyped data that was supplied to the validator, not the type-annotated data with expanded defaults.</p>

<p>Also, the examples provided for <strong><em>array:build</em></strong> and <strong><em>array:of</em></strong>, seem to have a good deal of common content / duplication / overlap.</p>
<p>Another issue is that <strong><em>array:of</em></strong> requires as input a sequence of  <strong>value records</strong>, whose definition is challenging to understand (and whose meaning seems to be solely to represent a sequence of sequences), and what is also really challenging is how to construct this argument to <strong><em>array:of</em></strong>.

<p>Is there an example where it is possible to construct an array (or a map) with <strong><em>array:of</em></strong> (or with <strong><em>map:of</em></strong>) but it is impossible (or significantly more difficult) to construct the same array/map with the function <strong><em>array:build</em></strong> (or with <strong><em>map:build</em></strong>)?</p>
<p>If there are no such significant and convincing examples, then why do we need the <strong><em>xxx:of</em></strong> functions?</p>

<p>This would empower function authors to select <code>xs:anyURI</code> as a type - signaling that they’re expecting a URI - without forcing users of the function into explicitly casting their string-typed URIs.</p>
<p>The motivation behind this proposal is that many eXist users are frustrated when using the eXist extension functions that properly declare parameters as <code>xs:anyURI</code>. If this proposal isn’t adopted, that’s ok; we’ll just eliminate the use of <code>xs:anyURI</code> in our functions, as proposed in https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/issues/4632. But this would a bit unfortunate for authors of functions who see the use of <code>xs:anyURI</code> as a proper expression of intent in their functions.</p>
<p>The change would be to https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-31/#promotion - and I guess would be a 3rd item, called "String type promotion", saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A value of type <code>xs:string</code> can be promoted to the type <code>xs:anyURI</code>. The result of this promotion is created by casting the original value to the type <code>xs:anyURI</code>.</p>

<p>If an <code>fos:expression</code> element is a code block, nest an <code>eg</code> inside it:</p>

<p>I found four examples where an <code>fos:expression</code> contained more than one newline and I added <code>eg</code> wrappers in those cases.</p>
<p>There are many more <code>fos:expression</code> elements that contain a single newline, but automatically formatting them as code blocks was often unsuccessful. Many of those cases seem to be just newlines entered for authoring convenience.</p>
<p>I also fixed the CSS for code blocks and attempte to remove trailing newlines from code blocks.</p>

<p>Inspired by https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/pull/454#issuecomment-1534633089 ff.</p>
<p>The syntax of the examples in the XQFO specification is inconsistent. Sometimes, functions in the standard function namespace have an <code>fn</code> prefix…</p>
<ul>
<li><code>fn:fold-right(1 to 5, "", fn:concat(?, ".", ?))</code></li>
<li><code>fn:substring("motor car", 6)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>…sometimes they don’t…</p>
<ul>
<li><code>data(123)</code></li>
<li><code>concat("http://www.example.com/", encode-for-uri("~bébé"))</code></li>
</ul>
<p>…sometimes it’s both:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>fn:fold-right(1 to 5, "$zero", concat("$f(", ?, ", ", ?, ")"))</code></li>
<li><code>fn:concat(01, 02, 03, 04, true())</code></li>
<li><code>fn:tokenize(fn:unparsed-text($href), '\r\n|\r|\n')[not(position()=last() and .='')]</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Should we drop or keep the prefix – or doesn’t it really matter? If there’s interest, I can create a PR (I’d tend to drop the prefixes).</p>
<p>In addition, there doesn’t seem to be a consistent rule for representing booleans. We have:</p>
<p>Syntax | Comment
--- | ---
…returns false | mostly used in the rules (seems appropriate to me)
…returns <code>false</code> | used in the rules; maybe we should use replace it with the first syntax?
…the result is <code>fn:false()</code> | used in the rules; maybe we should use replace it with the first syntax?
…returns <code>false()</code> | mostly used in the examples (seems appropriate to me)</p>

<hr>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>We have <code>fn:index-where</code> and <code>array:index-where</code> to locate items/members in a sequence/an array that match a specific predicate, and we could introduce an equivalent function for maps. A recent use case can be found in https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/413#issuecomment-1531288167d.</p>
<h3>Proposal</h3>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Returns keys of map entries for which the value matches a supplied predicate.</p>
<h4>Signature</h4>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">map:keys-where(
  $map        as map(*),
  $predicate  as function(item()*) as xs:boolean
) as xs:anyAtomicValue*
</code></pre>
<h4>Properties</h4>
<p>This function is ·deterministic·, ·context-independent·, and ·focus-independent·.</p>
<h4>Rules</h4>
<p>The function takes any ·map· as its <code>$map</code> argument and applies the supplied function to the value of each map entry. The function supplied as <code>$predicate</code> takes the value of the corresponding map entry as an argument, and the result is a sequence containing the keys of those entries for which the function returns true.</p>
<p>More formally, the function returns the result of the expression:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">map:for-each(
  $map,
  function($key, $value) {
    if($predicate($value)) then $key else ()
  }
)
</code></pre>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">let $numbers := map { 0: 'zero', 1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three' }
return map:keys-where($numbers, function($string) { $string = 'two' })
</code></pre>
<h3>Comments</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Edit (2023-05-04):</strong> Renamed from <code>map:key-where</code> to <code>map:keys-where</code>.</li>
<li>Similar functions (<code>index-of</code>, <code>index-where</code>) use the singular form.</li>
<li>An alternative would be to add an optional <code>$predicate</code> function argument to <code>map:keys</code>.</li>
<li>If we decide to introduce a shorter syntax (see <a href="https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/129">#129</a> and <a href="https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/129">#436</a>), we could have:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">map:keys-where($numbers, { . = 'two ' })

<blockquote>
<p>If the item-separator serialization parameter is absent, then for each subsequence of adjacent strings in S2, copy a single string to the new sequence equal to the values of the strings in the subsequence concatenated in order, each separated by a single space. Copy all other items to the new sequence. Otherwise, copy each item in S2 to the new sequence, inserting between each pair of items a string whose value is equal to the value of the item-separator parameter. The new sequence is S3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As written ("If...then.... Otherwise...."), this implies that the process whereby a block of adjacent strings are joined into a single string is performed only when the item separator parameter is absent. I.e., if the item-separator parameter is not absent, it will not be used to string-join adjacent groups of strings. Perhaps that is as intended, but I want to make sure.</p>
<p>Also, as written, this implies that when the parameter is absent, the sequence begins by finding all subsequences of adjacent strings, performing concatenation. Then all non-strings are added to the sequence. That seems wrong, because it appears to advise the processor to rearrange the sequence of input items.</p>
<p>I propose a revision along these lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Copy each item in S2 to a new sequence. If a given pair of adjacent items are both strings, then separate them with a string whose value is equal to the value of the item-separator parameter or is a single space if the item-separator parameter is absent. If a given pair of adjacent items are not both strings, insert between each pair of items a string whose value is equal to the value of the item-separator parameter. Once this is finished, take each adjacent group of strings and concatenate them into a single string. The new sequence is S3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My revision is based upon what I imagine happens, but implementers will know better than I.</p>
<p>I am working on some editorial touch-ups of the Serialization specifications, and can incorporate comments/suggestions made in this thread in that larger enterprise.</p>

<p>These aren't particularly convenient to use, for example getting multiple components of a duration is clumsy; and there are gaps, for example there are no functions to extract the parts of a <code>gMonthDay</code>.</p>
<p>I propose a general-purpose function <code>fn:parts()</code> which turns any of these composite atomic values into a map, enabling you to replace a call on <code>get-month-from-dateTime($value)</code> with <code>parts($value)?month</code>.</p>
<p>So far this dupllicates existing functionality perhaps with a bit of added convenience. However, the mechanism is much more extensible and flexible than what we have now:</p>
<ul>
<li>we can apply it to atomic types that currently have no decomposition operators, such as gMonthDay</li>
<li>we can easily add additional components such as <code>day-of-week</code> or <code>quarter</code> or <code>day-of-year</code> or <code>julian-day</code> that are currently not available, or only available clumsily using format-dateTime().</li>
<li>the parts() function is polymorphic, so the same code can be used to get the year (say) from a date, a dateTime, or a gYearMonth.</li>

<p>The idea is to define 3 parsing strategies:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>numeric</code> -- number-like systems such as decimal;</li>
<li><code>alphabetic</code> -- alphabetical-like systems such as spreadsheet columns (A, B, ..., Z, AA, AB, ...)</li>
<li><code>additive</code> -- systems like roman and hebrew where the symbol represents a fixed value that is added together</li>
</ol>
<p>Parsing these, we have 3 properties:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>system as enum("numeric", "alphabetic", "additive") := "numeric"</code> -- which of the parsing strategies (number systems) to use;</li>
<li><code>symbols as xs:string := "0123456789"</code> -- the list of characters used to represent a digit;</li>
<li><code>additive-symbols as map(xs:integer, xs:string) := map {}</code> -- a map of the symbols in an additive system with the corresponding value of that symbol.</li>
</ol>
<p>Consideration 1 -- Should these also allow any whitespace and optional "+"/"-" symbols like the radix-based parse-integer?</p>
<p>Consideration 2 -- Should we define decimal format options for these, so the decimal format name can format/represent other number systems (binary, hex, hebrew, tamil, roman numerals, etc.). -- Note: this would make <code>system</code>, <code>symbols</code>, and <code>additive-symbols</code> properties of the decimal format object with the above defaults. The formatting would work in the same way as it is defined in the CSS Counter Styles specification.</p>
<h2>Design 1 -- Separate functions</h2>
<pre><code>fn:parse-numeric-integer($value as xs:string,
                         $symbols as xs:string := "0123456789") as xs:integer

fn:parse-alphabetic-integer($value as xs:string,
                            $symbols as xs:string := "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ") as xs:integer

fn:parse-additive-integer($value as xs:string,
                          $additive-symbols as map(xs:integer, xs:string)) as xs:integer
</code></pre>
<h2>Design 2 -- Combined functions</h2>
<pre><code>fn:parse-integer($value as xs:string,
                 $system as xs:string := "numeric",
                 $symbols as xs:string := "0123456789",
                 $additive-symbols as map(xs:integer, xs:string) := map {}) as xs:integer

<p>I suggest we schedule this PR for discussion since we have not previously discussed it.</p>
<p>One question for the group is what the name of the function should be (including the choice of namespace).</p>
<p>Another is whether the polarity of the callback function should be changed (from <code>break-when</code> to <code>continue-when</code> or similar).</p>
<p>We could also consider returning an array of sequences rather than a sequence of arrays. (But in my view sequences of arrays are rather easier to manage at the moment.)</p>

<p>This is currently possible only if the schemas are compatible (that is, if the union of the schemas is itself a valid schema). And even where it is possible, validation against the union of S1 and S2 may produce a different outcome from validation against S2, for example because a strict wildcard allows content that S2 would not allow. Substitution groups are a particular problem: if v1 and v2 have elements with different substitution group membership, then validating against the union of v1 and v2 allows the union of the substitution groups, which means that you haven't actually verified that the result document is valid against v2.</p>
<p>The problem is confounded by considerations that are outside the scope of the spec. What happens when you run two different stylesheets against the same source document? If the source document has been validated against S1, this means that both stylesheets must use schemas that are supersets of S1. The way this requirement is managed in Saxon is to introduce the concept of a Configuration in which transformations run; a Configuration has a single schema, and all source documents and stylesheets within the Configuration must use compatible subsets of this schema. A source document validated using one Configuration cannot be used in a different Configuration, because the type annotations would be meaningless against a different schema.</p>
<p>My proposal is to introduce the idea of a named schema (that is, a named collection of schema components). When we do <code>xsl:import-schema</code>, we can give the imported schema a name, and there is no requirement that the components in this schema should be compatible with the components in any other schema. When we refer to a schema type (for example in <code>$s cast as QName</code>) we should be able to qualify the type name with a schema name (we can postpone discussions of syntax, let's say <code>cast as my:part-number§v1</code> for now). When we request validation, we should be able to nominate the schema to be used for validation, for example <code>&lt;xsl:element name="e" validation="strict" schema="v2"&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>The trickiest part is handling source documents, mainly because validation of source documents (especially those read using doc() or collection()) is at present almost entirely implementation-defined. I believe that we need explicit options to request validation of source documents against a specific schema. There should also be an option to validate a document against the schema identified in its own <code>xsi:schemaLocation</code>, in which case there should be no requirement that that schema is compatible with any schema known statically to the stylesheet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A consequence of this rule is that certain characters MUST be output as character references, to ensure that they survive the round trip through serialization and parsing. Specifically, CR, NEL and LINE SEPARATOR characters in text nodes MUST be output respectively as "&amp;#xD;", "&amp;#x85;", and "&amp;#x2028;", or their equivalents; while CR, NL, TAB, NEL and LINE SEPARATOR characters in attribute nodes MUST be output respectively as "&amp;#xD;", "&amp;#xA;", "&amp;#x9;", "&amp;#x85;", and "&amp;#x2028;", or their equivalents. In addition, the non-whitespace control characters #x1 through #x1F and #x7F through #x9F in text nodes and attribute nodes MUST be output as character references.
(The reference to "non-whitespace control characters" appears in a few other places as well, but for basically the same purpose.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But what <strong>are</strong> the "non-whitespace control characters"? The spec doesn't say. I think it means <em>all</em> of the C0 and C1 control characters except CR, NL, TAB, and NEL. The fact that vertical tab and line feed might be considered "white space" doesn't really matter anyway since none of the other C0 control characters are allowed in XML 1.0 anyway (encoded or otherwise).</p>
<p>XML 1.0 doesn't actually care about the C1 control characters. There's no reason to encode them, but it does no harm, I suppose. You'd have to encode the C0 and C1 control characters for an XML 1.1 parser, but none of those exist.</p>
<p>I wonder if it might be a little clearer to say</p>

<p>The current proposal uses <code>-&gt; { ... }</code> for just the thin arrow operator.</p>
<p>This proposal is split into two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>restructure the grammar to make the function call usage simpler to follow;</li>
<li>introduce the ability to use inline functions in thin/fat arrow contexts.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Part 1 -- Simplify the Grammar</h2>
<p>I suggest changing the grammar to:</p>
<pre><code>FatArrowTarget           ::= "=&gt;" ( ArrowFunctionCall | ArrowDynamicFunctionCall )
ThinArrowTarget          ::= "-&gt;" ( ArrowFunctionCall | ArrowDynamicFunctionCall )
ArrowFunctionCall        ::= EQName ArgumentList
ArrowDynamicFunctionCall ::= ( VarRef | ParenthesizedExpr ) PositionalArgumentList
</code></pre>
<p>That is, I've grouped the function name/reference with the argument list.</p>
<h2>Part 2 -- Allow Inline Functions</h2>
<pre><code>FatArrowTarget          ::= "=&gt;" ( ArrowFunctionCall | ArrowDynamicFunctionCall | ArrowInlineFunctionCall )
ThinArrowTarget         ::= "-&gt;" ( ArrowFunctionCall | ArrowDynamicFunctionCall | ArrowInlineFunctionCall )
ArrowInlineFunctionCall ::= ( "function" | "fun" ) EnclosedExpr
</code></pre>
<p>Note: here, <code>"fun"</code> is a placeholder for whichever name/symbol we choose in https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/53.</p>
<p>This then allows expressions like <code>(1, 2, 3) -&gt; function { . + 1 }</code> and <code>(1, 2, 3) =&gt; fun { ~ = 1 }</code> (see also https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/129) without overloading the meaning of <code>-&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>This makes the thin/fat arrows consistent in behaviour with each other, with the exception of how they pass the value to the expressions:</p>
<ol>
<li>thin arrow operators pass the values in the sequence one at a time to the associated function;</li>
<li>fat arrow operators pass all the values in the sequence to the associated function in a single call.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<ol>
<li>Update the syntax:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>[46] FatArrowTarget  ::= "=&gt;" ((ArrowStaticFunction ArgumentList) | (ArrowDynamicFunction PositionalArgumentList)) 	
[47] ThinArrowTarget ::= "-&gt;" ((ArrowStaticFunction ArgumentList) | (ArrowDynamicFunction PositionalArgumentList))
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>Remove the text for the inline function variant:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>

<p>For example, the expression $x -&gt; {.+1} is equivalent to ($x)!(.+1).</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Remove/update the associated examples, e.g. to use <code>let $f := function ($x) { $x + 1 } return $x -&gt; f() -&gt; $f()</code>.</li>

<p>Hi @michaelhkay . I took a slightly different approach. For unknown reasons long since lost in the mists of time the 'etc' files that act as databases for cross-spec references stored <code>nt</code> elements. That's weird because the <code>nt</code> elements are supposed to point to <code>prod</code> elements. I expect someone (let's be candid, probably me) got confused by the fact that <code>nt</code> elements have a <code>def</code> attribute and thought they were definitions. They're not. I've changed things so that the <code>prod</code> elements are now stored in the database. There's only going to ever be one of those.</p>
<p>I had to tidy up a few things to make that work, and we can't abandon support for <code>nt</code> files in 'etc' documents because we have existing files that don't get regenerated.</p>
<p>I also cleaned up the cross-reference error to <code>StringLiteral</code> in the XSLT spec and patched over a problem with a few link in the XQuery specifications.</p>

(: hexadecimal :) 0x1, 0X00Ff,
(: binary :)      0b1, 0B11111111,

On the other hand XPath is very useful to us as the centerpiece of XSLT, XQuery</p>
<p>In order to allow people to have a more expanded use of XPath without to have to get the whole XSLT, XQuery story, it is perhaps the time to consider adding a thin layer of spec in order to have</p>
<ol>
<li>XPath</li>
<li>Some typing definition mechanism</li>
<li>Some function definition mechanism</li>
</ol>
<p>The idea is also to better integrate this with all Validation technologies (XSD, Relax NG, NVDL, JSONSchema, etc.) and allow EXPath, EXQuery and other to have a standard way to use all this around</p>
<p>We also want people that want to use only XPath (for example in LinQ or inside SQL) to have a broader capacity to interact with XML (instead of being limited to XPath 1.0 with namespaces)</p>
<p>I will try to add more and more precision to this proposal along the line, but I feel it is good enough to be a first stone to break and allow people to help drive this initiative</p>
<p>For the moment the name of this new beast is <strong>XPathWithCustomizableTypesAndFunctions</strong> in our proposal call XPath Next https://github.com/XPath-Next/XPath-Next/blob/first-draft/spec.md</p>

<p>It is possible for <code>xsl:next-match</code> or <code>xsl:apply-imports</code> to encounter a conflict - two template rules with the same precedence and priority.

<p>This restriction is unnecessary and we should remove it. As people become more accustomed to using function items, they don't want to hit restrictions like this, and there's really no good implementation reason for it.</p>

<p>Consider the pattern <code>p except appendix//p</code>. Anyone writing this probably imagines that this will match any <code>p</code> element that does not have an <code>appendix</code> as an ancestor. The intuitive meaning of <code>A except B</code> is to match anything that matches<code>A</code> unless it also matches <code>B</code>.</p>
<p>The actual meaning in the XSLT 3.1 specification is that it matches any node <code>$N</code> that has an ancestor <code>$A</code> such that the result of the XPath expression <code>$A//(p except appendix//p)</code> includes <code>$N</code>.</p>
<p>Consider the XML</p>
<pre><code>&lt;appendix&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/appendix&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element here has an ancestor (the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element) where the result of <code>$A//(p except appendix//p)</code> includes the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element. So despite having an ancestor <code>appendix</code> this element matches the pattern <code>p except appendix//p</code>. This is not only a counter-intuitive result, it also makes such patterns useless in practice.</p>
<p>Patterns using <code>intersect</code> suffer the same problem, though it is much harder to construct a plausible example.</p>
<p>Patterns that only use the child or attribute axis, for example <code>@* except @code</code>, or <code>* except note</code>, don't suffer from this problem and will retain the same meaning as in 3.1.</p>
<p>The required effect can be achieved by writing <code>p except p[ancestor::appendix]</code>. Because the pattern <code>p[ancestor::appendix]</code> is equivalent to <code>appendix//p</code>, people are very likely to imagine that <code>p except p[ancestor::appendix]</code> is equivalent to <code>p except appendix//p</code>.</p>
<p>Making any incompatible change to the language semantics should be done only with a very strong justification, but I believe that it is justified in this instance. The existing semantics are not only counter-intuitive, they are also sufficiently useless that it is extremely unlikely anyone has existing working code, other than artificial test cases, that relies on the current semantics.</p>

<p>TODO: define default priorities for type patterns, as suggested in https://www.saxonica.com/papers/xmlprague-2020mhk.pdf section 6.5.1</p>
<p>We need to plug this gap. [Note: it's worth reading that cited section as it points out some of the difficulties].</p>
<p>I'm going to suggest an alternative approach. Rather than allocating a numeric priority to patterns such as <code>record(lat, long)</code>, we allocate them a relative priority -- called their <code>selectivity</code> -- based on the subtype relationship among types. This is a partial ordering. So we extend the rule that currently orders patterns by (1) import precedence, (2) priority, (3) declaration order, to become instead (1) import precedence, (2) selectivity, (3) priority, (4) declaration order.</p>
<p>Type-based patterns (such as <code>type(xs:integer)</code>, <code>record(lat, long)</code>) are defined to have higher selectivity than any non-type-based pattern; all the latter (that is, all XSLT 3.1 patterns) are defined to have equal selectivity, which means the rules for discriminating among 3.1 patterns are unchanged.</p>
<p>For type-based patterns, we define that a pattern based on type T has higher selectivity than a pattern based on type U if T is a subtype of U. If neither is a subtype of the other, then they have equal selectivity.</p>
<p>The type pattern <code>type(T)</code> followed by one or more predicates is deemed to have higher selectivity than type(T) with no predicates, but apart from this, the predicates are ignored. Explicit numeric priorities can be used to define an ordering among type patterns that have the same selectivity.</p>

The feature probably still needs some work, which this issue aims to explore.</p>
<p>The main purpose of introducing named item types is that the ItemType for a record structure or a function signature can become quite complex and lengthy, and you don't want to have to repeat them every time they are used because it means you have to make the same change everywhere when a change occurs. Another motivation is to allow type definitions (for example, of records or functions) to be recursive.</p>
<p>I considered allowing named sequence types rather than just item types, but the rules for where you can and can't have an occurrence indicator get complicated, so I pulled back from that.</p>
<p>It seems natural to say:</p>
<ul>
<li>Item type names are QNames</li>
<li>In XPath, type names (and their mapping to item types) appear in the static context</li>
<li>In XQuery, type names follow the conventions for global variables and function declarations. That suggests they can appear either in the main module or a library module; in a library module they must be in the namespace of the module; they can be annotated as %public or %private; an <code>import module</code> declaration makes the name visible in the importing module.</li>
<li>In XSLT, a name declared in a module is automatically available throughout the stylesheet package, and can be exposed to other packages using the same visibility mechanisms as other stylesheet components. However, I don't think it makes sense to allow a type name to be overridden, either using import precedence or using xsl:override.</li>
</ul>
<p>The question then arises, should item type names be in the same "symbol space" as named atomic and union types? There seem to be several options here:</p>
<p>(a) Item type names are in a different symbol space from atomic types; the are no rules barring the same name being used for a named item type and an atomic type, and they are disambiguated by requiring item type names to be distinguished using some kind of marker syntax such as <code>type(name)</code>, rather than just a bare name.
(b) Item type names are in the same symbol space as atomic types, which means there must be a rule that an item type name must not be the same as an atomic type name that is visible in the same place. We could try and define this rule for individual names, or at the level of namespaces (if there are any atomic/union types in a particular namespace in the static context of any module, then there must be no declared type names in that namespace in that module, either declared in that module or imported from another module).
(c) Atomic type names "shadow" item type names, or vice versa: if the same name is used for both, then one of them takes precedence. Probably not a good idea.</p>
<p>I'm inclined to go for (b). Note that a simple rule that item type names can't be in a reserved namespace will prevent conflict for all non-schema-aware applications, since those applications only access atomic types in the <code>xs</code> namespace.</p>
<p>Now, what about circular definitions?</p>
<p>There are legitimate circular definitions, like <code>declare item type LIST = record(payload as item()*, next? as LIST)</code>, and there are "impossible" definitions, like <code>declare item type THING = THING</code>. Do we have to define the rules needed to ban "impossible" definitions, or can we just leave it that the determination of whether something is an instance of THING is non-terminating? I think we probably need to define the rules, which will require careful thought.</p>
<p>Where can item type names be used? The simple answer is: anywhere an ItemType is allowed. But what about contexts that only allow some ItemTypes and not others? For example, (a) "cast as", (b) as arguments of a LocalUnionType, (c) as the key type in a map type. (The solution in the current draft is that the syntax allows any ItemType to be used in these contexts, and there are semantic rules to constrain what kind of item types are allowed).</p>
<p>If we allow <code>$v cast as my:X</code> where <code>my:X</code> is a declared item type name, should we also allow the constructor function  <code>my:X($v)</code>? That would presumably also mean that item type names and function names cannot overlap.</p>
<p>Should we define any "built-in" item type names? We've been defining built-in functions (such as build-uri and parse-uri) whose signatures use record type definitions. Should we define built-in names for these record definitions?</p>
<p>An editorial issue: I think it's becoming increasingly difficult to get away with overloading the word <code>ItemType</code> to mean both the abstract concept of an item type, and the specific BNF construct used to define it. Same for <code>SequenceType</code>. I think we should probably move to having a defined term "item type" and a BNF construct such as <code>ItemTypeDesignator</code> to represent the two separate meanings.</p>

Consider <code>fn:parse-uri("querty:abc")</code>:</p>
<pre><code>map {
  "path":"abc",
  "scheme":"querty",
  "path-segments":["abc"],
  "uri":"querty:abc"
}
</code></pre>
<p>When <code>fn:build-uri</code> parses that map, it produces: <code>querty://abc</code> because the scheme is not known to be non-hierarchical.</p>
<p>This PR changes <code>fn:parse-uri</code> so that it records whether or not the URI was hierarchical and <code>fn:build-uri</code> to use that information.</p>
<p>It's possible that we could finesse this by setting the <code>authority</code> to the empty string for hierarchical URIs, but it seems clearer to be explicit.</p>
<p>This PR also fixes a bug. Previously, if the <code>scheme</code> was not present when building a URI, the URI began with <code>//</code>. That's an error. If the scheme isn't present, there should be no <em>scheme separator</em>.</p>

It doesn't help that there's no official RFC for <code>file:</code> URIs.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>file:/path/part</code> is a <code>file:</code> URI with no host and a path of <code>/path/part</code>.</li>
<li><code>file:///path.part</code> is a <code>file:</code> URI with an explicitly empty host and a path of <code>/path/part</code>.</li>
<li><code>file://path/part</code> is a <code>file:</code> URI with an authority of <code>path</code> and a path of <code>/part</code>. I think one common way to interpret this is as if it was <code>file:/part</code>. That is, in <code>file:</code> URIs, although a different host is possible, it's often just ignored.</li>
<li><code>c:\path\part</code> is most usefully interpreted as <code>file:/c:/path/part</code>, a <code>file:</code> URI with no host and a path of <code>/c:/path/part</code>. These are only going to be useful on a Windows system, so it isn't a problem to treat them the same way on all platforms. (Aside: I don't actually know if the path part should be <code>c:/path/part</code> instead, but it's currently got the leading slash in <code>fn:parse-uri()</code>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>And then there's this: <code>file:////name/path/part</code>.</p>
<p>One interpretation is, "look, we accept <code>file:/</code> and <code>file:///</code> so let's just accept <code>file://</code> and <code>file://///////</code>, etc. as the same." And I think that's generally right, with the single special exception of <code>file:////</code>. The problem is that on Windows, this is a very common way to encode the URI for a UNC path, that is: <code>\\name\path\part</code> which is a Windows UNC path for <code>\path\part</code> on a host named <code>name</code> (via whatever networking protocol backs UNC).</p>
<p>You'd think that this should be <code>file://name/path/part</code>, but I think because browsers and maybe other tools just discard the authority part of a <code>file:</code> URI (or maybe because these are <em>paths</em> in some Windows sense?), that's not how they're encoded.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aside: Yes, I'm sure you also see <code>file:\\\\name\path\part</code> and <code>file:c:\path\part</code> and other forms as well. Those are out of scope, they're simply, flatly, completely wrong. You can't use <code>\</code> as a delimiter in a URI. RFC 3986 is authoritative on this point. Step one of dealing with random strings we think should be URIs is replacing all <code>\</code> with <code>/</code> because RFC 3986.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's problematic to deal with <code>file:////</code> as a special case, but it's also problematic to leave out support for a common pattern on a widely deployed operating system.</p>
<p>Recognizing four slashes after <code>file:</code> and treating that specially isn't hard. The hard part is how do we encode this in the map that <code>fn:parse-uri</code> produces bearing in mind that the result should round-trip if you push it back through <code>fn:build-uri</code>.</p>
<p>Consider <code>file:////uncname/path/part</code></p>
<p>Today, that is parsed as:</p>
<pre><code>map {
  "uri": "file:////uncname/path/part",
  "scheme": "file",
  "authority": "uncname",
  "host": "uncname",
  "path": "/path/to/file",
  "path-segments": array { "", "path", "to", "file" }
}
</code></pre>
<p>and that doesn’t round trip. If you feed that to <code>fn:build-uri</code>, you get <code>file://uncname/path/part</code> and that absolutely doesn’t mean the same thing on a Windows machine.</p>
<p>We could encode the slashes in the <code>authority</code> in which case we also have to encode them in the <code>host</code> because in the presence of <code>host</code>, the <code>authority</code> isn’t used to by <code>fn:build-uri()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>map {
  "uri": "file:////uncname/path/part",
  "scheme": "file",
  "authority": "////uncname",
  "host": "////uncname",
  "path": "/path/to/file",
  "path-segments": array { "", "path", "to", "file" }
}
</code></pre>
<p>It kind of works, but it’s really ugly and it means we have a host value that is a complete kludge. It doesn’t match the RFC rules for hostnames at all.</p>
<p>The other option that occurs to me is to add a “unc-path” property to the map:</p>
<pre><code>map {
  "unc-path": true(),
  "uri": "file:////uncname/path/part",
  "scheme": "file",
  "authority": "uncname",
  "host": "uncname",
  "path": "/path/to/file",
  "path-segments": array { "", "path", "to", "file" }
}
</code></pre>
<p>That works but it introduces all sorts of possibilities for incoherent data, such as an <code>https:</code> URI with a <code>unc-path</code> flag set to <code>true()</code>.</p>
<p>What’s the right answer?</p>
<ol>
<li>Ignore the UNC path special case, it’s the users problem to deal with them.</li>
<li>Recognize them, encode the details in the <code>authority</code> and <code>host</code>.</li>
<li>Recognize them, use a special property like <code>unc-path</code>.</li>
<li>Recognize them, and do this other much better idea I have: ________________</li>
</ol>

<p>On the one hand, in order for <code>fn:deep-equal</code> to be most easily used as a comparison function in the many contexts where a comparison function is required, it would be best if it simply returned <code>false()</code> rather than raising an error when incomparably items are encountered.</p>
<p>On the other hand, making "return false()" the default will mean that it is possible to construct items that are not equal to themselves, which will certainly violate the expectations of some users.</p>
<p>This conflict needs to be resolved somehow.</p>

<p>The specification would be something like,
Elements and attributes associated with an ignored element prefix are not treated as direct constructors, and are removed when the stylesheet is compiled. For such an element, this is equivalent to having an xsl:use-when attribute with value false on the element; for attributes, they are simply discarded along with their value.</p>
<p>It is not an error for a prefix to be listed both as an ignored element prefix and as an extension element prefix; the result is implementation dependent in this case, but MUST not result in neither an extension being invoked nor the element or attribute being ignored.</p>
<p>Ignored elements may appear anywhere in the input tree, and ignored attributes may appear on any element.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;xsl:template match="city/park" css:module="main"&gt;
  &lt;css:rule&gt;
    color: green;
    trees: tall;

It's not at all clear why these should be the same. For types, the vast majority of QNames representing types are in the XML Schema namespace, which is never used for elements.</p>
<p>In the current 4.0 drafts the two default namespaces are separated; but this has not been reviewed or agreed by the CG. This issue is raised for discussion of the change, and I will also review the design to see whether it still make sense.</p>
<p>Some observations on the current text for XQuery:</p>
<ol>
<li>In section 2.2.1 (static context) it would be good to give a bit more detail (if only as a forwards reference) about the circumstances in which the default element namespace and the default type namespace are used.</li>
<li>In 3.4 Sequence Types the sentence "[Lexical QNames]appearing in a [sequence type] have their prefixes expanded to namespace URIs by means of the [statically known namespaces] and (where applicable) the [default element namespace] or [default type namespace]" is rather inelegantly worded. If there is a prefix, then the statically known namespaces are used; if there is none, then the relevant default namespace is used, and it would be nice to explain more clearly which one applies.</li>
<li>In 3.6 Item Types, we need to be clearer about references to named/declared item types, and about how the names are resolved. Do we really want these names to be in the same symbol space as atomic types? Perhaps we should have a rule that Item Types (like functions) must be in a namespace and this must not be the same as an imported schema namespace.</li>
<li>In 5.14, Default namespace declaration, there seems to be duplication between the two paragraphs starting "for backwards compatibility reasons"</li>
<li>Appendix C.1 (much though I dislike it) should say something about the initialisation of the default namespaces for elements and for types.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that issue #65 talks of the need for different default namespaces for input and output elements. I think that's a separate issue.</p>
<p>Observations on the current text for XSLT:</p>
<ol>
<li>In 5.1.2.1 the paragraph "The [xsl:]xpath-default-namespace attribute must be in the [XSLT namespace] if and only if its parent element is not in the XSLT namespace needs to be generalised to [xsl:]default-element-namespace. In fact, this rule should move to the parent section 5.1.2, which needs an introduction.</li>
</ol>

Essentially, I think "namespace clutter".</p>
<p>Namespace clutter manifests itself in several different ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, declaration clutter in source code. Here's the start of a module in an XSLT Stylesheet of medium complexity:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>&lt;xsl:stylesheet 
    xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" 
    xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" 
    exclude-result-prefixes="#all"
    version="3.0" 
    xmlns="http://ns.saxonica.com/xslt/export" 
    xmlns:doc="http://www.saxonica.com/ns/documentation"
    xmlns:map="http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/map" 
    xmlns:ex="http://ns.saxonica.com/xslt/export" 
    xmlns:f="MyFunctions" 
    xmlns:t="MyTypes"
    expand-text="true"&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Eight namespace declarations here, of which 3 are concerned with functions; and  Wit can get a lot worse than that.</p>
<ul>
<li>Secondly, namespace clutter in the static and dynamic context. The namespace bindings shown above don't disappear when the code is compiled; even with exclude-result-prefixes="yes", they have to hang around at run-time just in case someone tries to resolve a QName dynamically. Preserving the namespace context in the expression tree through optimization rewrites is a significant cost that has no user benefit; very rarely are they actually going to use the namespace context at run time.</li>
<li>Thirdly, prefix clutter in the executable code. Writing <code>math:cos(math:cos($x))</code> is just so clumsy compared with <code>cos(cos($x))</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think there are a number of things we can do to reduce this.</p>
<p>First, separate out the namespace context for static resolution of function names as a separate part of the static context, used only for this purpose. Ensure that there is no functionality that depends on knowing this part of the static context at run time, so it can be discarded by the compiler as soon as function names are resolved. Then provide source syntax for binding function prefixes to function namespaces in XSLT and XQuery to populate this part of the static context; there is no reason this has to be done using XML namespace declarations. There is also no reason for having different bindings in force in different parts of a single module. And once we've separated these declarations from XML namespace declarations, there's no reason why we can't provide default bindings. We could also allow bindings to have cross-module scope to reduce duplicated code. Note: the xsl:function-library proposal in the current XSLT 4.0 draft tries to achieve some of these things.</p>
<p>Second, allow functions to be referenced by local name alone where the reference is unambiguous; and perhaps provide some aliasing mechanisms to make more existing names unambiguous.</p>
<p>We've explored a third idea, which is to introduce some kind of polymorphism where function names have local scope and are distinguished by the types of objects to which they are applied. I think that given our type system, this is very hard to achieve and I haven't seen any very satisfactory proposals. We also need to remember that there are considerable costs if we start resolving function names dynamically at run time. I wouldn't rule out making progress in this direction, but I'm not optimistic of coming up with a workable solution. There might be some simple things we could do, like having a single function <code>size()</code> that performs the work of both <code>map:size()</code> and <code>array:size()</code> depending on the argument.</p>

F(., B, C)</code> which means that B and C are evaluated with a focus based on the current item in A, not with the outer focus. This is different from the <code>=&gt;</code> operator. For example if the $E is an element E, with several children called F, then</p>
<p><code>namespace-uri(.) -&gt; fn:QName(name())</code></p>
<p>has a different effect from</p>
<p><code>namespace-uri(.) =&gt; fn:QName(name())</code></p>
<p>whereas it might reasonably be expected that in the case where the LHS produces a single value, the two operators are equivalent. We can't change the meaning of <code>=&gt;</code> because it's defined in 3.1. So should we change the meaning of <code>-&gt;</code> to fall into line?</p>
<p>We could do this easily enough by defining <code>A -&gt; F(B, C)</code> as equivalent to <code>for $a in A return F($a, B, C)</code>.  I think that as well as being more consistent with <code>=&gt;</code>, the result is probably more intuitive. (We could also define it as equivalent to <code>let $f := F(?, B, C) return A ! $f(.)</code>)</p>
<p>For the expression <code>A -&gt; {B}</code>, and for the proposed <code>A =&gt; {B}</code>, I don't think we have any choice other than evaluating B with an inner focus based on A. But at least we can do it consistently for both operators.</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>Developers tend to get creative if they want to suppress the result of an expression. The reason is that there is no simply solution to do this properly. Some constructs I have seen in practice:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">let $unused := EXPRESSION
return 'ok'

EXPRESSION[position() = 10000], 'ok'

let $result := 'ok'
return if(exists(EXPRESSION)) then $result else $result
</code></pre>
<p>Cases like this are frequent in nondeterministic code. Think e.g. of side-effecting functions of the EXPath HTTP-Client and File Modules: The function results are not always relevant for the invoking application, or already known.</p>
<p>The function is also helpful during development and for testing code. <code>fn:void#1</code> and <code>fn:identity#1</code> can both be passed on to functions to either return or ignore the result of their arguments. The function can potentially be used to measure the runtime performance of an expression (but an implementation should not be prevented from discarding the function call if the argument expression is deterministic).</p>

<p>There are two natural representations of a key-value pair (K, V): it can be represented as a singleton map (<code>map{ K: V }</code>) or as a "doubleton" map (<code>map{ 'key': K, 'value': V}</code>).</p>
<p>This issue examines how well either of these representations is currently supported, which of them is preferable, and how this support should be improved.</p>
<p>I'll consider the following basic operations: constructing a KVP from a key and a value, assembling a map from a set of KVPs, decomposing a map into a sequence of KVPs, extracting the key from a KVP, and extracting the value from a KVP.</p>
<p><strong>Singleton Representation</strong></p>
<p>Constructing a KVP from a key and a value:</p>
<pre><code>map{ $key : $value }
map:entry($key, $value)
&lt;xsl:map:entry key="$key" select="$value"/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Assembling a map from a set of KVPs</p>
<pre><code>map:merge($kvps)
&lt;xsl:map&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Decomposing a map into a sequence of KVPs:</p>
<p><code>map:for-each($map, map:entry#2)</code></p>
<p>Extracting the key from a KVP:</p>
<p><code>map:keys($kvp)</code></p>
<p>Extracting the value from a KVP:</p>
<p><code>$kvp?*</code></p>
<p><strong>Doubleton Representation</strong></p>
<p>Constructing a KVP from a key and a value:</p>
<pre><code>map{ 'key': $key, 'value': $value }
</code></pre>
<p>Assembling a map from a set of KVPs</p>
<p><code>map:build($kvps, -&gt;{?key}, -&gt;{?value})</code></p>
<p>Decomposing a map into a sequence of KVPs:</p>
<p><code>map:for-each($map, -&gt;($K, $V){map{ 'key': $key, 'value': $value })</code></p>
<p>Extracting the key from a KVP:</p>
<p><code>$kvp?key</code></p>
<p>Extracting the value from a KVP:</p>
<p><code>$kvp?value</code></p>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p>The singleton representation is better supported at present, and it makes sense therefore to fill in the gaps that currently make it awkward. The main attraction of the doubleton representation is the ease of extracting the key and the value using <code>$kvp?key</code> and <code>$kvp?value</code>. The equivalents for the singleton representation (<code>map:keys($kvp)</code> and <code>$kvp?*</code>) feel clumsy and unintuitive; however, it's not at all obvious what would be better, short of introducing new custom syntax, which seems over-the-top. The best idea I can come up with is to have two functions <code>map:key($kvp)</code> and <code>map:value($kvp)</code> which require $kvp to be a singleton map. But I hate the namespace prefixes...</p>
<p>The other thing needed to "fill the gaps" is a function <code>map:entries($map)</code> equivalent to <code>map:for-each($map, map:entry#2)</code>.</p>
<p>What if we chose to go the other way, and improve support for the doubleton representation?</p>
<p>We could add <code>map:key-value-pair($key, $value)</code> to create  KVP, and <code>map:of($kvps)</code> to build a map from a set of KVPs, and <code>map:key-value-pairs($map)</code> to decompose a map. The trickiest problem is what to do about XSLT, where the 3.0 instructions <code>&lt;xsl:map&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;xsl:map-entry&gt;</code> use the singleton representation.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>This function is not lossless</strong> -- any members that are the empty sequence or the empty array are not represented in the returned result.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1>2. Suggested solution(s)</h1>
<p>We want to have a function that is similar to the wrongly defined one, but produces its contents as an array, and is lossless. There are two obvious ways to do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Correct the specification of   <strong><a href="https://qt4cg.org/specifications/xpath-functions-40/Overview-diff.html#func-array-flatten"><code>array:flatten</code></a></strong> so that its result is an array and it represents the empty sequences and empty arrays as the same members of its result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add to the Specification a new function: <strong><code>array:leaves</code></strong> that produces an array as its result and that is lossless.
<strong>array:leaves</strong> returns an array whose members are exactly all the leaves of the input array, by the order of their appearance. By definition leaves are all, and at any depth, members that are not an array except when they are the empty array. Thus () (the empty sequence) and [] (the empty array) are leaves by definition.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><em>Solution 2. will not cause any compatibility issues</em></strong>.</p>
<h1>3. Examples</h1>
<p>The expression <strong><code>array:leaves([1, (), [4, 6], 5, 3])</code></strong> returns <strong><code>[1, (),  4, 6, 5, 3]</code></strong>.</p>
<p>The expression <strong><code>array:leaves([1, 2, 5], [[10, 11], 12], [], 13)</code></strong> returns <strong><code>[1, 2, 5, 10, 11, 12, [], 13]</code></strong>.</p>

<p>As initially discussed in issue #341, we were exploring different ways to provide an XPath-like language to traverse in depth composite objects such as maps and arrays and select their members at any depth.
While working on this, the idea of an XPath-like language for composite items started to emerge and here we present this idea in a more or less crystalized form.</p>
<h2>1. Root Component</h2>
<p>Any CompPath expression must start off a composite item (of type map or array, or of other future composite item type (maybe set? )  ).
This can be a literal composite item or a reference to a variable whose value is a composite item.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xq">
(: Literal composite items: :)
[1, 2, 3]

[1, [2,  3]]?2

{"x":1, "y" : map{ "z": 2}}

{"x":1, "y" : map{ "z": 2}} ?y

(: Variables containing composite items: :)
let $comp1 := [1, [2, 3]],
 $comp2 :=$comp1 ?2,
 $comp3 := {"x":1, "y" : map{ "z": 2}},
 $comp4 := $comp3 ?y
</code></pre>
<p>In the above examples all literal expressions and all variables (<strong><code>$comp1, $comp2, $comp3, $comp4</code></strong>) may serve as the root component for a CompPath expression.</p>
<h2>2. The component-path operator (\)</h2>
<p>The component-path operator "\" is used to build expressions for locating members at any depth within component trees. Its left-hand side expression must return a result that is a composite item or else this result is represented as such by wrapping it into an array.</p>
<p>The operator returns an array, the values of whose members are composite items themselves or any such value may be a non-composite "leaf" in the root-component tree).</p>
<p>Each operation E1\E2 is evaluated as follows: Expression E1 is evaluated, and the result is wrapped in an array A1. If any member of A1 is not a composite item, a type error is raised.
Each member of A1 serves in turn  to provide an inner "composite-focus" (the member as the "composite-context-item" or <strong><code>.</code></strong>, its index in A1 as the "composite-context-position" or <strong><code>index()</code></strong>, the set of keys of the composite-context-item as the "composite-keyset" or <strong><code>keys()</code></strong> and the size of this member as the "composite-context-size" (specified as one of: <strong><code>size()</code></strong>, or <strong><code>array-size()</code></strong> or <strong><code>key-size()</code></strong>) ) for the evaluation of E2. The result of each evaluation of  E2, if it isn't a single composite item, is wrapped in a single array. The arrays resulting from all the evaluations of E2 are wrapped  in a single array and this single array is the result of the evaluation.</p>
<p>E2 is typically a function over the <em>context-focus</em>  and its results will be the set of the next step composite-context-items (used as the left-hand-side of the next in chain composite-step-expression (see below)), or these results would be the final results of evaluation if this is the last-in chain composite-step-expression.</p>
<h2>3. Composite-Steps</h2>
<p>A <strong>composite-step</strong> is a part of a composite-path-expression that generates an array and filters its members by zero or more predicates. A <strong>composite-step-expression</strong> is either a <em>CompositeAxisStep</em> or a <em>CompositePostfixExpression</em>.</p>
<h2>4. Composite-Axes</h2>
<p>The following axes are defined for traversing a composite-item tree:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong><code>child-member::</code></strong> axis contains the members of the composite-context-item.</li>
<li>The  <strong><code>value-member::</code></strong>  axis contains the members of the composite-context-item that are not composite themselves.</li>
<li>The  <strong><code>node-member::</code></strong>  axis contains the members of the composite-context-item that are nodes.</li>
<li>The <strong><code>descendant-member::</code></strong> axis is defined as the transitive closure of the <strong><code>child-member::</code></strong> axis; it contains the descendent-members of the composite-context-item (the child members of the composite-context-item, and their child-members, ... and so on).</li>
<li>The <strong><code>self::</code></strong> axis contains just the composite-context-item.</li>
<li>The <strong><code>descendant-member-or-self::</code></strong> contains the composite-context-item and all of its descendent-members.</li>
<li>The <strong><code>following-sibling-member::</code></strong> axis contains the members of the immediate container of the composite-context-item that follow it. For any two members <strong><em>mem1</em></strong> and <strong><em>mem2</em></strong> of a composite item <strong><em>Comp</em></strong>, by definition <strong><em>mem2</em></strong> follows <strong><em>mem1</em></strong> if and only if <strong><em>Comp</em></strong> is an array and the index of <strong><em>mem2</em></strong> in <strong><em>Comp</em></strong> is greater than that of <strong><em>mem1</em></strong>, or if <strong><em>Comp</em></strong> is a map, then the key of <strong><em>mem2</em></strong> is greater than that of <strong><em>mem1</em></strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong><code>preceding-sibling-member::</code></strong> axis contains the members of the immediate container of the composite-context-item that precede it. For any two members <strong><em>mem1</em></strong> and <strong><em>mem2</em></strong> of a composite item <strong><em>Comp</em></strong>, by definition <strong><em>mem1</em></strong> precedes <strong><em>mem2</em></strong> if and only if <strong><em>Comp</em></strong> is an array and the index of <strong><em>mem2</em></strong> in <strong><em>Comp</em></strong> is greater than that of <strong><em>mem1</em></strong>, or if <strong><em>Comp</em></strong> is a map, then the key of <strong><em>mem2</em></strong> is greater than that of <strong><em>mem1</em></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, <strong><code>following-sibling-member::5</code></strong> means all members of the composite-context-item with index &gt; 5,
and <strong><code>preceding-sibling-member::5</code></strong> means all members of the composite-context-item with index &lt; 5</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If the immediate container of the composite-context-item is a map whose key-values cannot be ordered, then specifying either of the <strong><code>following-sibling-member::</code></strong> or <strong><code>preceding-sibling-member::</code></strong> axes on this composite-context-item must raise a type error. (Obviously, these two axes are meaningful only for composite items, whose members are ordered, such as the array).</p>
<p>If the composite-axis name is omitted from a composite-axis step, the default axis is <strong><code>child-member::</code></strong></p>
<h2>5. Composite Axis Steps</h2>
<p>A composite axis step completely resembles the ordinary axis step in XPath. It consists of three parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>The composite axis  (<strong><code>child-member::</code></strong>, <strong><code>descendant-member::</code></strong>, <strong><code>value-member::</code></strong>, <strong><code>node-member::</code></strong>, <strong><code>following-sibling-member::</code></strong>, <strong><code>preceding-sibling-member::</code></strong>, <strong><code>self::</code></strong>, or the <strong><code>descendant-member-or-self::</code></strong> axis)</li>
<li>The member test</li>
<li>The composite-predicates</li>
</ol>
<h2>6. Member Tests</h2>
<p>A member test is a condition on the key-name, index, or kind (<em>composite</em>, <em>map</em>, <em>array</em> or <em>value</em>, <em>node</em>, or (any) <em>member</em>). A member test determines which members contained by a copmosite-axis are selected by a composite-step.</p>
<p>As such, a member test is either an <em>identifier-test</em> (key-name or index) or a <em>kind-test</em> (<em>composite</em>, <em>map</em>, <em>array</em>,  <em>value</em>, or <em>member</em>)).</p>
<p>Examples of member identifiers:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A string specifies a name of a key, whose value will be selected. For example: <strong><code>\child-member::X</code></strong> selects from the composite-context-item the value corresponding to its key which has the name "X".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>\child-member::3</code></strong> selects from the composite-context-item the value of its 3rd member, if it is an array or the value corresponding to its key <strong><code>3</code></strong>, if it is a map.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>following-sibling-member::3</code></strong> selects from the composite-content-item (which is most-likely an array) all of its members having index greater than 3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>preceding-sibling-member::3</code></strong> selects from the composite-content-item (which is most-likely an array) all of its members having index less than 3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>\descendant-member-or-self::X</code></strong> selects from the composite-context-item (that must be a map) and from all its descendant-members, the values corresponding to their key named "X", if these descendents have a key named "X".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly <strong><code>\5</code></strong> is equivalent to <strong><code>\child-member::5</code></strong> and selects from the composite-context-item that is an array the value of its 5th member. This will also select the value corresponding to the key <strong><code>5</code></strong> from the composite-context-item if it is a map, because on the <strong><code>child-member::</code></strong> axis both maps and arrays may be selected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>\X</code></strong> is equivalent to <strong><code>\child-member::X</code></strong> and selects from the composite-context-item (that must be a map), the value corresponding to its key which has the name "X".</p>
<p>There is also the pseudo-operator <code>\\</code> . This is an abbreviation for:</p>
<p><strong><code>\descendant-member-or-self::member()\</code></strong></p>
<p>Thus, <strong><code>\\X</code></strong> means: "(Deep) Select all members of the root-component that are the corresponding values of keys equal to 'X' "</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We may use a <strong><em>kind test</em></strong> as part of the previous example, if we want to select only a specific kind of members of the composite-context-item.
<strong><code>\array()</code></strong>  In this example, although we are on the <strong><code>child-member::</code></strong> axis, we want to select only members of the composite-context-item that are arrays.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>\map()</code></strong>  In this example, although we are on the <strong><code>child-member::</code></strong> axis, we want to select only members of the composite-context-item that are maps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>\value()</code></strong>  In this example we want to select only members of the composite-context-item that are not composite items themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>\node()</code></strong>  In this example we want to select only members of the composite-context-item that are nodes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>\member()</code></strong>  In this example we want to select all members of the composite-context-item, regardless whether they are maps, arrays, or values.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>6.1 Wildcards</h3>
<p>The <strong><code>*</code></strong> wildcard can be used instead of a member identifier. Its meaning is to select all existing members of the composite-context-item, that is possibly selected by a specific axis and limited by a specific member kind-test.</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>\*</code></strong>  (: (Shallow) Selects all members of the composite-context-item :)</li>
<li><strong><code>\map()\*</code></strong>  (: Selects from the composite-context-item all values that correspond to a key of any map-member of the composite-context item :)</li>
<li><strong><code>\array()\*</code></strong>  (: Selects from the composite-context-item all members of all its members that are arrays :)</li>
<li><strong><code>\\*</code></strong>  (: (Deep) Select all members of the composite tree rooted by the root-component :)</li>
</ul>
<h2>7. Predicates</h2>
<p>As defined above, a <strong>composite-step</strong> has three parts: <em>composite-axis</em> (can be omitted and then a default axis is used), <em>member test</em>, and an optional <em>list of composite-predicates</em>.</p>
<p>A <strong><em>composite-predicate</em></strong> in a composite-step is an expression used as a <em>filter</em> applied on the members of the composite-context-item that are already selected by the axis and member tests of the axis step, and not filtered out by any preceding composite-predicates in the <em>composite-predicates-list</em>. The composite-predicate may be any XPath expression and is written within double square brackets.</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>\*[[3]]</code></strong>  (: Selects any member of the composite-context-item, that is an array and has a 3rd member or any member of the composite-context-item, that is a map and has a key <strong>3</strong> :)
This is a shorthand for: <strong><code>\*[[array-size() ge 3 or 3 = keys()]]</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>\array()[[3]]</code></strong> (: Selects those array members of the composite-context-item that have a 3rd member :)
This is a shorthand for: <strong><code>\*[[size() ge 3]]</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>\*[[size() eq 7]]</code></strong>  (: Selects those members whose array-size() or key-size() is exactly 7:)
This is a shorthand for: <strong><code>\composite::*[[self::map() and key-size() eq 7 or self::array() and array-size() eq 7]]</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>\*[[X]]</code></strong>  (: Selects any member of the composite-context-item, that is a map and has a key <strong>X</strong>  :)</li>
<li><strong><code>\map()[[X]]</code></strong> (: Selects any map member of the composite-context-item, that has a key <strong>X</strong>  :)
The above two expressions are a shorthand for: <strong><code>\*[['X' = keys()]]</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>\value()[[. gt 0]]</code></strong> (: Selects any value (non-composite member) of the composite-context-item, that is a positive number :)</li>
</ul>
<h2>8. Mixing CompPath and XPath expressions</h2>
<p>CompPath and XPath expressions can be used as parts of a single expression:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A CompPath expression may be appended at the end of any XPath expression that produces a composite-object .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An XPath expression may be appended at the end of any CompPath expression. When doing this,</p>
<p><strong><code>CompPathExpr / XPathExpr</code></strong></p>
<p>is equivalent to:</p>
<p><strong><code>CompPathExpr\node::* / XPathExpr</code></strong></p>
<p>And this:</p>
<p><strong><code>CompPathExpr ! XPathExpr</code></strong>  (:  Note: also causes ordering and deduplication of the nodes! :)</p>
<p>is equivalent to:</p>
<p><strong><code>CompPathExpr\value::* !  XPathExpr</code></strong>  (: Note: No ordering or deduplication, can be applied on any item, not just on nodes :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A CompPath expression may be substituted for the expected argument of any XPath expression, for example:
<strong><code>count(MyCompPathExpr)</code></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any XPath expression that produces a composite item can be used as the composite-root for any CompPath expression</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xq">let $myBooks := 
&lt;books&gt;
 &lt;book name="Tom Sawyer"&gt;
   &lt;author&gt;Mark Twain&lt;/author&gt;
 &lt;/book&gt;
 &lt;book name="Wuthering Heights"&gt;
   &lt;author&gt;Emily Brontë&lt;/author&gt;
 &lt;/book&gt;
 &lt;book name="Jane Eyre"&gt;
   &lt;author&gt;Charlotte Brontë&lt;/author&gt;
 &lt;/book&gt;
 &lt;book name="Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"&gt;
   &lt;author&gt;Mark Twain&lt;/author&gt;
 &lt;/book&gt;
&lt;/books&gt;,
$map1 := map {"science-works": map{"Einstein": "Special Theory of relativity",
                                  "Darwin" : "On the Origin of Species"
                                 },
             "literature" : map{"19the Century": $myBooks}
            }
return
  $map1\literature\\*/book[author eq 'Mark Twain']
</code></pre>
<p>Evaluating this mixed CompPath and XPath expression produces the correct result:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xq">&lt;book name="Tom Sawyer"&gt;
  &lt;author&gt;Mark Twain&lt;/author&gt;
&lt;/book&gt;
&lt;book name="Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"&gt;
  &lt;author&gt;Mark Twain&lt;/author&gt;
&lt;/book&gt;
</code></pre>

For example, this expression results in error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xq">[
  map {"k0": 1}, 
  map{"k0": [1, 2, 3]}
]  ?* ?("k0")  ?*
</code></pre>
<p><strong>[XPTY0004] Input of lookup operator must be map or array: 1.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>There are three possible types of reaction to this problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do nothing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relax the semantics of the map/array lookup operator "<strong>?</strong>" so that it can be applied on items of non-map/non-array type and in such case produce the empty sequence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Introduce a similar operator to "<strong>?</strong>" that will behave as it, but instead of producing an error when applied on items of non-map/non-array type it produces the empty sequence.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously, we are not advocating the 1st choice above, or otherwise we wouldn't be raising any issue 😄</p>
<p>Choice 2 could be implemented, but this would have a few drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>it would bring a certain degree of backwards incompatibility</li>
<li>"silently returning nothing" is really difficult to debug or even notice unexpected results, as pointed out by @michaelhkay</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This proposal is to choose alternative 3. above</strong>.</p>
<p>Why is it better than the 2nd one?</p>
<ul>
<li>No incompatibility can be introduced, as this is a new operator.</li>
<li>The user has intentionally chosen this operator over the "?" operator, and this means that the user is well aware of the new, sometimes tricky to observe/explain/debug behavior, but the user doesn't mind these effects and is ready to deal with them.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>By definition the operator <strong>"-&gt;"</strong> with left-hand-side any expression <strong><em>E</em></strong> and right-hand-side a literal string  <strong><em>X</em></strong>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><code>E -&gt; X</code></strong></p>
<p>is lexically expanded to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><code>E[. instance of map(*) or . instance of array(*)]?X </code></strong></p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>With the original expression provided by Jarno Elovirta, but now using the <strong>"-&gt;"</strong> operator:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xq">[
  map {"k0": 1}, 
  map{"k0": [1, 2, 3]}
]  -&gt;* -&gt;("k0")  -&gt;*
</code></pre>
<p>its evaluation produces the expected result (all the values within just one of the leaves of the tree), and no error:</p>
<p><strong><code>1, 2, 3</code></strong></p>
<p>That is, <strong><code>1 -&gt;*</code></strong>  produces the empty sequence and no error.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>:</p>
<p>Of course, the above example can be rewritten to this equivalent XPath 3.0 expression and will get the wanted result, but literally no one, myself included, will ever write this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xq">[
 map {"k0": 1}, 
 map{"k0": [1, 2, 3]}
] [. instance of map(*) or . instance of array(*)]      ?*
           [. instance of map(*) or . instance of array(*)]      ?k0
                                [. instance of map(*) or . instance of array(*)]   ?*
</code></pre>

<p>As known from the other functions for formatting numbers and dates, it could be up to the implementation to decide which languages are supported.

<blockquote>
<p>If the <code>document-uri</code> is not the empty sequence, then the following constraint must hold: the node returned by evaluating <code>fn:doc()</code> with the document-uri as its argument must return the document node that provided the value of the <code>document-uri</code> property.</p>
<p>In other words, for any Document Node <code>$arg</code>, either <code>fn:document-uri($arg)</code> must return the empty sequence or <code>fn:doc(fn:document-uri($arg))</code> must return <code>$arg</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This contraint turns out to be inconvenient whenever the larger environment doesn’t enforce a 1:1 mapping between URIs and documents.</p>
<p>For example, in a browser context, a JavaScript function that returns different versions of the same document over time cannot identify those documents with the same document-uri.</p>
<p>In XProc, a <code>p:add-attribute</code> step that returns a copy of its input document with one additional attribute, cannot identify the output document with the same document-uri as the input document.</p>
<p>Given that the document URI is often necessary to evaluate relative URI references within a document, the constraints imposed in the data model are too strict.</p>

<p>I note that the definitions of <strong>generalized atomic type</strong> and <strong>pure union type</strong> say they must be "schema-defined", which appears to exclude locally-defined union and enum types.</p>
<p>I wonder if the definition of local enum types should be aligned more closely with an XSD type derived from xs:string by restricting with an enum facet. Now that we allow down-casting in the coercion rules, the objections to this seem to disappear.</p>
<p><code>cast</code> and <code>castable</code> should also probably pay more attention to these types.</p>

<p>Most of the problems boil down to this: JSON trees do not have parent pointers, therefore after navigating down to a leaf node of the tree, we cannot get any information from higher up the tree. The solution to this (the "zipper" model) is to retain transient information about how a particular node in the tree was reached, so that we can retrace our steps and revisit nodes that were passed en route.</p>
<p>The change I propose is quite minor, but powerful: Any XDM value can be augmented with a set of transient properties represented as a set of key-value pairs. These properties are ignored (and typically dropped) by all operations on a value, except where otherwise specified. For the purpose of exposition, I'll use the syntax <code>$value¶name</code> to refer to the transient <code>name</code> property of <code>$value</code>.</p>
<p>We'll change the semantics of <code>map:get()</code> and <code>array:get()</code>, and the associated lookup operators, so that the resulting values have transient properties indicating how they were selected. For example, given</p>
<p><code>let $name := $person?firstName</code></p>
<p>the resulting value (perhaps the string "Michael") will be augmented with transient properties</p>
<ul>
<li>¶parent - the map from which the value was selected (retaining its own transient properties if any)</li>
<li>¶key - the key used to make the selection, here "firstName"</li>
</ul>
<p>and derived properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>¶ancestors - the transitive closure of ¶parent</li>
<li>¶root - the last ¶ancestor</li>
<li>¶path - a string representation of the path used to select the value</li>
</ul>
<p>We can also define other "downward selection" operations such as <code>map:find</code>, and <code>array:foot</code> to retain these transient properties. So for example <code>map:find($json, 'firstname')[.='Michael']¶parent?surname</code> now finds the surnames of anyone named 'Michael', at any depth of the tree.</p>
<p>If we turn back to the use cases in my 2016 paper on transforming JSON</p>
<p>https://www.saxonica.com/papers/xmlprague-2016mhk.pdf</p>
<p>The first use case (bulk update) relied on matching items expressed in XML as</p>
<p><code>match="map[array[@key='tags']/string='ice']/number[@key='price']/text()"</code></p>
<p>which couldn't be done in JSON because of the inability to match based on ancestor context. With the new transient properties we can match this as</p>
<p><code>match="type(xs:integer)[¶key = 'price'][¶parent?tags?* = 'ice']"</code></p>
<p>In the second use case (hierarchic inversion), we can again get properties of parent or ancestor maps</p>
<p><code>$students ! map:put("course", ¶parent?name)</code></p>
<p>I think we can also use this to define deep update operations. But I'll leave that investigation until later.</p>
<p>Note: transient properties potentially have many other applications, for example we might use them to solve our problems with <code>document-uri()</code>. But exploring that would be a distraction here. The nice thing about transient properties is that they give a lot of potential for augmenting existing functionality with full backwards compatibility, because we can define existing operations to return results with additional transient properties that all existing operations will ignore. If we were so minded, for example, we could have different functions/operators return "quiet NaN" and "signalling NaN" by adding a transient property to the NaN value returned.</p>

<p>1.7.4 makes a brave attempt to describe situations under which two functions are "identical", though leaving implementations room for flexibility. I think we can build on this and improve it, by describing more situations in which the result is predictable.</p>
<p>The data model describes the properties of a function item, and we can say that two function items are equivalent if all their properties are the same.</p>
<p>The properties that cause problems are the "implementation" and the "closure", and in both cases I think we can find ways of doing a comparison.</p>
<p>For the implementation, we can define this by reference to the way in which the implementation property is set. For function items constructed by reference to static functions (e.g. <code>my:func#3</code> or <code>function-lookup(my:func, 3)</code>) then they have the same implementation if and only if they are constructed by reference to the same static function. Similarly for function items constructed by evaluating an inline function expression. Other ways of constructing a function item, such as partial application, essentially create a new function with the same implementation as an existing function and a different closure.</p>
<p>For the closure (ignoring for the moment functions that include parts of the dynamic context in their closure), this is essentially just a set of variable bindings and it's not too difficult to say that functions are identical if these sets of variable bindings are identical.</p>

Things are getting particularly tricky if we consider partial function applications.</p>
<p>My proposal would be to stick with the existing error code <code>XPST0017</code> for functions that cannot be matched.</p>
<p>Initial suggestion (obsolete):</p>
<ol>
<li>use the existing error code <code>XPST0017</code> for all cases in which a function cannot be chosen as the available arguments (both positional and keyword-based) don’t match the function definition, and</li>
<li>only raise a new error code (<code>XPST0141</code>, possibly) if a keyword argument has been specified more than once (as this can be done without checking the function definitions).</li>

<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-31/#id-switch">XQuery switch cases</a> have a peculiar restriction: The operand of a single case must yield an empty sequence or a single item. There seem to be no (obvious) reasons why this restriction exists, so I believe we should lift it and allow arbitrary sequences.</p>
<p>A similar extension is planned for Java 12 (<a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/325">JEP 325: Switch Expressions</a>). The required changes in XQuery are simpler, though, as the 3.1 grammar already supports arbitrary expressions as operands.</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">switch($value)
  case 1
  case 2
  case 3
  case 4
  case 5
    return 'small'
  default
    return 'big'
</code></pre>
<p>Proposed syntax:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">switch($value)
  case 1 to 5
    return 'small'
  default
    return 'big'
</code></pre>
<h2>Required Changes</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-31/#id-switch">current matching rules</a> could be rephrased as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The SwitchCaseOperand is evaluated.</li>
<li>The resulting value is atomized.</li>
<li>The case matches if the value is empty and if the value of the switch expression is empty as well.</li>
<li>Otherwise, the atomized value of the switch operand expression is compared with each item of the atomized value of the SwitchCaseOperand using <code>fn:deep-equal</code>, with the default collation from the static context.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>When tokenizing, the longest possible match that is consistent with the EBNF is used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>needs clarifying. It could be read as suggesting that if taking the longest match turns out to lead to a syntax error, the tokenisation should be re-attempted using a shorter match. I don't think that has ever been intended. So what exactly does the qualifier "that is consistent with the EBNF" actually mean?</p>
<p>Possibly related, A.2.2 Terminal Delimitation states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Terminal symbols that are not used exclusively in [/* ws: explicit */] productions are of two kinds: delimiting and non-delimiting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But (at least in the XQuery version) the list of delimiting tokens includes a number that are indeed used exclusively in ws:explicit productions, for example a number of tokens containing back-ticks, and <code>]]&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>I think we need to be clearer that tokens used in ws:explicit productions are recognised only when parsing the production that uses them. For example given the expression <code>A[B[C]]&gt;3</code>, we should not recognise <code>]]&gt;</code> as a token under the longest-token rule. I think that's probably what the "consistent with the EBNF" rule is intended to convey.</p>

<p>So it'd be great to have them use xsl:text instead of xsl:value-of, where text nodes are wanted, because then introducing xsl:sequence is a small step.</p>
<p>Of course, beginners also often use value-of where they should be using apply-templates, e.g. to handle mixed content! But again, using xsl:text reduces that temptation.</p>
<p>We do have value templates now, <a href="xsl:text">xsl:text</a>{ .... }&lt;/xsl:text&gt;, which mitigates the need slightly, but i think only slightly, because the select= analogy is very compelling.</p>

<pre><code>            &lt;xsl:map&gt;
               &lt;xsl:map-entry key="'author'" select="string(AUTHOR)"/&gt;
               &lt;xsl:map-entry key="'title'" select="string(TITLE)"/&gt;
               &lt;xsl:map-entry key="'price'" select="xs:decimal(PRICE)"/&gt;
               &lt;xsl:map-entry key="'publisher'" select="string(../@name)"/&gt;
           &lt;/xsl:map&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The alternative using XPath is also rather ugly:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;xsl:sequence select="map{'author': string(AUTHOR),
                                                 'title':string(TITLE), 
                                                 'price': xs:decimal(PRICE), 
                                                 'publisher':string(../@name)}"/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>(the fact  that it is creating a map doesn't stand out; the <code>xsl:sequence</code> is a distraction because there's no sequence involved; and many users dislike long multi-line XPath expressions because of formatting problems in their editing tools)</p>
<p>I propose a new instruction xsl:record which allows:</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;xsl:record author="string(AUTHOR)"
                                title="string(TITLE)" 
                                price="xs:decimal(PRICE)" 
                                publisher="string(../@name)"/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This is rather like literal result elements in that the attributes are user-defined rather than system-defined. Unlike LREs, the values are general expressions rather than AVTs, because the values are not necessarily strings. The instruction can only be used where the keys (field names) take the form of NCNames.</p>
<p>If variable entries are required, or entries whose keys are not NCNames, they can appear as child instructions:</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;xsl:record author="string(AUTHOR)"
                                title="string(TITLE)" 
                                price="xs:decimal(PRICE)" 
                                publisher="string(../@name)"&gt;
              &lt;xsl:if test="@private"&gt;
                  &lt;xsl:map-entry name="'private entry'" select="true()"/&gt;
              &lt;/xsl:if&gt;
          &lt;/xsl:record&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Follow the tradition of LREs, duplicates are resolved as "last one wins".</p>
<p>If "standard attributes" such as <code>[xsl:]version</code> are required, they must be in the XSLT namespace, as with LREs.</p>

https://qt4cg.org/specifications/xpath-functions-40/Overview-diff.html#func-serialize</p>
<p>Would it be possible to relax the strictures on <code>$input</code> (first parameter) of <code>fn:serialize()</code>?</p>
<ol>
<li>The specifications do not explicitly forbid <code>map(*)</code> or <code>array(*)</code> as input, but in practice, when these are supplied, Saxon rejects them. Developers (or at least this one) who work with arrays and maps often need to render them in string output or messages, if only for diagnostics. If there is something really prohibitively wrong with those two items as input to <code>fn:serialize()</code>, then the specifications should say so.</li>
<li>Attributes are forbidden, but it is unclear why. They get serialized fine in the context of a parent, why not alone?</li>
<li>Namespace nodes are forbidden; see previous point.</li>
</ol>
<p>(No doubt there must have been discussion on points 2-3, but the rationale is not clear from the specs.)</p>
<p>Perhaps the question is that the details of what the serialization should look like is contestable. I think the answer there is simply, pick one. I think we'll happily live with whatever is chosen.</p>
<p>For the serialization of maps and arrays, I'll point as one possible model my <a href="https://github.com/textalign/TAN-2021/blob/9d2215e36da1f64bddad9daddfc5aa2242e17c81/functions/maps/TAN-fn-maps-extended.xsl#L58">tan:map-to-xml()</a> and <a href="https://github.com/textalign/TAN-2021/blob/9d2215e36da1f64bddad9daddfc5aa2242e17c81/functions/arrays/TAN-fn-arrays-extended.xsl#L66">tan:array-to-xml()</a>, which have been indispensable for daily troubleshooting.</p>

Please respond with xrefs to anything relevant.</p>
<p>Draft here:
https://qt4cg.org/specifications/xpath-functions-40/Overview.html#func-differences</p>
<p>IMO, this function seems overly complicated for both users and implementors. The specs provide difficult reading. But it is the first function to try to address the desideratum for differencing. Something like it is needed methinks.</p>
<p>My suggestion would be to simplify the function as a straightforward string comparison, i.e., change the signature to something like <code>fn:differences($input1 as xs:string, $input2 as xs:string) as OUTPUT</code> where <code>OUTPUT</code> is either a tree structure (like the output of <code>fn:analyze-string()</code>) or a sequence of records (e.g., <code>(is-in-1 as xs:boolean, is-in-2 as xs:boolean, fragment as xs:string)</code>).</p>
<p>Such a change would make the function more tractable for both users and implementers. The user, would need to cast each sequence to a string, and in so doing will be able to (be compelled to) make fine-grained decisions on things such as normalization. Processor implementers have far simpler input, and they can choose the difference algorithm that makes best sense at the moment.</p>
<p>One counterargument might be that the resultant output would be difficult to correlate to the original sequences. Ostensibly, one wants to do things such as decide whether to drop certain items in sequence 1 or sequence 2. My response is that the current draft results in output that suffers from the same problem. Navigating the map to correlate it to the original sequence sounds daunting. With my suggestion, there are ways around this, through auxiliary functions or arity expansions that normalize the output.</p>
<p>But I don't want to get postprocessing output here, which would be tangential to the main question, i.e., how <code>fn:differences()</code> should be constructed in a way conducive to both users and implementers.</p>

The basic facilities needed for transformation of maps and arrays are the ability to decompose them into their parts, manipulate the parts, and the compose new arrays and maps from these parts.</p>
<p>Further background is in my 2022 Balisage paper, https://balisage.net/Proceedings/vol27/html/Kay01/BalisageVol27-Kay01.html</p>
<p>This proposal considers only the "shallow" operations on maps and arrays. Further proposals for deep search and update of nested structures are to be expected.</p>
<h2>Basics</h2>
<p>A map entry is an item used to represent a key-value pair in a map; it is an item of type <code>record(key as xs:anyAtomicType, value as item()*)</code>, aliased in this proposal as <code>type(map-entry)</code>.</p>
<p>Note: <em>an alternative representation for key-value pairs is as a singleton map, and that's the representation used by the existing map:entry() function and by the xsl:map-entry instruction. A representation as <code>record(key, value)</code> is rather more convenient to enable extraction of the key and value, but does create some compatibility issues...</em></p>
<p>An array entry is an item used to represent a member of an array; it is an item of type <code>record(value as item()*)</code>, aliased in this proposal as <code>type(array-entry)</code>.</p>
<h2>Decomposing Maps and Arrays</h2>
<p>The function <code>map:entries($map)</code> returns a sequence of map entries, in unpredictable order, representing the contents of the supplied map. It is equivalent to <code>map:for-each($map, -&gt;($k, $v){map:entry($k, $v)})</code>.</p>
<p>The function <code>array:entries($array)</code> returns a sequence of array entries, in array order, representing the members of the supplied array. It is equivalent to <code>array:for-each($array, -&gt;($v){array:entry($v)})</code>.</p>
<h2>Constructing Maps and Arrays</h2>
<p>The function <code>map:of($entries as type(map-entry)*) as map(*)</code> constructs a map from a sequence of map entries. A second parameter, <code>$options</code>, is available to control handling of duplicates, as with <code>map:merge()</code>. The function is equivalent to <code>map:merge($entries!map{'key':?key, 'value':?value})</code>.</p>
<p>The function <code>array:of($entries as type(array-entry)*) as array(*)</code> constructs an array from a sequence of array entries. It is equivalent to <code>array:fold-left($entries, [], array:append#2)</code>.</p>
<p>The function <code>map:entry($key, $value) as type(map-entry)</code> is equivalent to <code>map{'key':$key, 'value':$value}</code>. <em>Problem: we already have a function map:entry() in 3.1 that does something different. Need to change the terminology...</em></p>
<p>The function <code>array:entry($value) as type(array-entry)</code> is equivalent to <code>map{'value':$value}</code>.</p>
<h2>Filtering Maps and Arrays</h2>
<p>The construct <code>$map?[PREDICATE]</code> is equivalent to <code>map:of(map:entries($map)[PREDICATE])</code>. For example, given a map in which the keys are dates, <code>$map?[year-from-date(?key)=2023]</code> returns a map containing those entries in which the key is a date in 2023.</p>
<p>The construct <code>$array?[PREDICATE]</code> is equivalent to <code>array:of(array:entries($array)[PREDICATE])</code>. For example, <code>$array?[1]</code> selects the first item in the array (as a single-member array), while <code>$array?[exists(?value)]</code> returns an array containing all those entries in the input array that are not empty. If <code>$array</code> is an array of maps, then <code>$array?[?value?name='John']</code> selects those members of the array that are maps having <code>?name='John'</code>.</p>
<h2>Mapping Maps and Arrays</h2>
<p>The construct <code>$map!!EXPR</code> evaluates <code>EXPR</code> once for each entry in <code>$map</code> and returns the result as a flattened sequence. For example <code>map:of($map!!map:entry(?key, ?value+1))</code> returns a map in which each value has been incremented by one.</p>
<p>The construct <code>$array!!EXPR</code> evaluates <code>EXPR</code> once for each entry in <code>$array</code>, and returns the result as a flattened sequence. For example, <code>array:of($array!!array:entry(?value+1))</code> returns an array in which every value has been incremented by one.</p>
<h2>FLWOR Expressions</h2>
<p>The for-member clause <code>for member $m in $array</code> is equivalent to <code>for $sys:var in array:entries($array) let $m := $sys:var?value</code>.</p>
<p>The for-entry clause <code>for entry ($k, $v) in $map</code> is equivalent to <code>for $sys:var in map:entries($map) let $k := $sys:var?key, $v := $sys:var?value</code>.</p>
<h2>XSLT</h2>
<p>Iteration over maps and arrays is achieved using <code>&lt;xsl:for-each select="array:entries()"&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;xsl:for-each select="map:entries()"&gt;</code> directly.</p>
<p>Construction of maps uses the existing instructions <code>&lt;xsl:map&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;xsl:map-entry&gt;</code>. There is an inconvenience here in that the <code>&lt;xsl:map-entry&gt;</code> instruction returns a singleton map (<code>map{key:value}</code>) rather than a map entry as defined in this proposal (<code>map{'key':key, 'value':value}</code>)..</p>
<p>Construction of arrays uses the new instructions <code>&lt;xsl:array&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;xsl:array-entry&gt;</code>. The <code>xsl:array-entry</code> instruction is defined to construct an array entry as defined in this proposal.</p>

<p>The spec says that these rules apply to "source trees" defined as "any tree provided as input to the transformation. This includes the document containing the [global context item] if any, documents containing nodes present in the [initial match selection], documents containing nodes supplied as the values of [stylesheet parameters], documents obtained from the results of functions such as [document], [doc], and [collection]...".</p>
<p>I guess one reasonable interpretation is that the "such as" includes <code>parse-xml()</code>. But it goes rather against the grain that the behaviour of parse-xml() should be affected by the containing stylesheet declarations, when there is no mention of such a context-dependency in the function specification; in this, parse-xml() is rather different from doc() which deliberately says very little about how the XDM instance returned relates to the URI supplied as input.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>is a little bit ambiguous for my taste. By "are not normalized" it means "no action is taken to normalize the strings", it doesn't mean "the strings will not be in normalized form".</p>
<p>I suggest: "Unless explicitly stated, the functions in this document operate on strings as sequences of codepoints and do not attempt to convert input strings, or produce output strings, in Unicode normalized form. Unicode normalization occurs only when explicitly requested, for example by use of the <code>fn:normalize-unicode</code> function."</p>

Shortcutting and lazy hints</strong></h1>
<p>Let us have this expression:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xq">let $f := function($arg1 as item()*, $arg2 as item()*) as function(item()*) as item()*
             {  (: Some code here :) }
  return
    $f($x) ($y)
</code></pre>
<p>Evaluating&nbsp;<strong><code>$f($x)</code></strong>&nbsp;produces a function. The&nbsp;<strong>actual arity</strong>&nbsp;of this resulting function can be any number&nbsp;<strong><code>N &gt;= 0</code></strong> :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If&nbsp;<strong><code>N &gt; 1</code></strong>&nbsp;there would be arity mismatch error, as only one argument&nbsp;<code>$y</code>&nbsp;is provided in the expression.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If&nbsp;<strong><code>N = 1</code></strong>&nbsp;the final function call can be evaluated, and the argument&nbsp;<code>$y</code>   must be evaluated,  or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If <code>N = 0</code>, then  <code>$y</code> is unneeded and can safely be ignored</strong> according to the updated <strong>“<a href="https://qt4cg.org/pr/279/xquery-40/xpath-40.html#id-coercion-rules">Coercion Rules / Function Coercion</a>”</strong> in Xpath 4.0.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Because a possibility exists to be able to ignore the evaluation of&nbsp;<code>$y</code>, it is logical to delay the evaluation of&nbsp;<code>$y</code>&nbsp;until the actual arity of&nbsp;<code>$f($x)</code>&nbsp;is known</strong>.</p>
<p>The current XPath 4.0 evaluation rules do not require an implementation to base its decision whether or not to evaluate&nbsp;<code>$y</code> on the actual arity of the function produced by <code>$f($x)</code>, thus at present an implementation could decide to evaluate <code>$y</code> regardless of the actual arity of the function produced by <code>$f($x)</code>.</p>
<p><strong>This is where a&nbsp;<em>lazy</em>&nbsp;hint comes</strong>: it indicates to the XPath processor that <em><strong>it is logical to make the decision about evaluation of&nbsp;<code>$y</code>&nbsp;based on the actual arity of the function returned by&nbsp;<code>$f($x)</code></strong></em>.</p>
<p>A rewrite of the above expression using a <strong><em><em>lazy</em></em></strong>&nbsp;hint looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xq">let $f := function($arg1 as item()*, $arg2 as item()*) as function(item()*) as item()*
             {  (: Some code here :) }  
  return
    $f($x) (lazy $y)
</code></pre>
<p>Here is one example of a function with short-cutting and calling it with a <strong><em>lazy</em></strong> hint:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xq">let $fAnd := function($x as xs:boolean, $y as xs:boolean) as xs:boolean
             {
                let $partial := function($x as xs:boolean) as function(xs:boolean) as  xs:boolean
                                {
                                  if(not($x)) then -&gt;(){false()}
                                              else -&gt;($t) {$t}
                                }
                 return $partial($x)($y)
             }
  return
     $fAnd($x (: possibly false() :), lazy&nbsp;$SomeVeryComplexAndSlowComputedExpression)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Without the <strong><em>lazy</em></strong>&nbsp;hint in the above example, it is perfectly possible that an XPath implementation, unrestricted by the current rules, would evaluate <em><code>$SomeVeryComplexAndSlowComputedExpression</code></em> - something that is unneeded and could be avoided completely</strong>.</p>
<h2>Formal syntax and semantics</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The <strong><em>lazy</em></strong> keyword should immediately precede any argument in a function call. If specified, it means that <strong><em>it is logical to make the decision about evaluation of this argument based on the actual arity of the function in this function call</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Based on this definition, it follows that <strong><em><code>lazy $argK</code></em></strong> implies <strong><em>lazy</em></strong> for all arguments following <code>$argK</code> in the function call. Thus specifying more than one <strong><em>lazy</em></strong> hint within a given function call is redundant and an implementation may report this redundancy to the user.</p>
<p>The scope of a <strong><em>lazy</em></strong> keyword specified on an argument is this and all following arguments of (only) the current function call.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is possible to specify a <strong><em>lazy</em></strong> keyword that is in force for the respective argument(s) of all function calls of the given function. To do this, the <strong><em>lazy</em></strong> keyword must  be  specified immediately preceding a parameter name in the function definition of that function.</p>
<p>For example, if the function <strong><code>$f</code></strong> is specified as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xq">let $f := function($arg1 as item()*, lazy $arg2 as item()*, $arg3 as item()*, $arg4 as item()* ) 
          { (: some code here:) }
  return
     $someExpression
</code></pre>
<p>Then any call of <strong><code>$f</code></strong> in its definition scope that has the form:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xq">$f($x, $y, $z, $t)
</code></pre>
<p>is equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xq">$f($x, lazy $y, $z, $t)
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is possible to specify the <strong><em>lazy</em></strong> keyword immediately preceding a function definition. This instructs the XPath processor that any call of this function is only necessary to be evaluated if the function is actually called during the evaluation of the expression that contains this function call.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xq">let $complexComputation := lazy function($x, $y) {$x + $y}, (: Make it as complex as you want ... :)
     $someCondition := function()
        {
            let $date := current-date()
              return
                  month-from-date($date) eq 2
                and 
                 day-from-date($date) eq 29 
       }
  return if($someCondition()) 
           then $complexComputation(2, 3)
           else 0
</code></pre>
<p>Specifying the <strong><em>lazy</em></strong> keyword in the function definition for <code>$complexComputation</code> can save significant computing resources, because the programmer knows that <code>$someCondition()</code> is true during only a single day in any 4-years period.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1><strong>II.fn:lazy</strong></h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Applied on a single argument that can be any <em>expression</em>. Lazily returns its argument <em>expression</em>.</p>
<h2>Signature</h2>
<pre><code class="language-xq">lazy fn:lazy( 
        $expression as item()*
) as item()*
</code></pre>
<h2>Properties</h2>
<p>This function is <strong><em><a href="https://qt4cg.org/specifications/xpath-functions-40/Overview.html#dt-deterministic">deterministic</a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href="https://qt4cg.org/specifications/xpath-functions-40/Overview.html#dt-context-independent">context-independent</a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href="https://qt4cg.org/specifications/xpath-functions-40/Overview.html#dt-focus-independent">focus-independent</a></em></strong></p>
<h2>Rules</h2>
<p>The semantics of the function is strictly defined below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xq">let $lazyFunction := lazy fn:identity#1
   return
      (: AnyExpression here :)
</code></pre>
<p>Any expression <strong><code>Q</code></strong> of the form:</p>
<p><strong><em><code>Q(E1, lazy(E2))</code></em></strong></p>
<p>where <strong><code>E1</code></strong> and <strong><code>E2</code></strong> are subexpressions of <strong><code>Q</code></strong>, must be evaluated by the Processor in two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Substitute the expression</p>
<p><strong><em><code>Q(E1, lazy(E2))</code></em></strong></p>
<p>with:</p>
<p><strong><em><code>Q(E1, ?) (lazy E2)</code></em></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evaluate the latter according to the rules for a <strong><em>lazy</em></strong> argument</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>We can use almost the same example as above, but here <code>$complexComputation</code> is defined without the <strong><em>lazy</em></strong> keyword and thus is not a <strong><em>lazy</em></strong> function. To have <code>$complexComputation</code> evaluated lazily, we call the <code>lazy()</code> function, passing <code>$complexComputation</code>  to it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xq">let $complexComputation := (: no lazy here :) function($x, $y) {$x + $y}, (: Make it as complex as you want ... :)
     $someCondition := function()
        {
            let $date := current-date()
              return
                  month-from-date($date) eq 2
                and 
                 day-from-date($date) eq 29 
       }
  return 
        $someCondition() and lazy( $complexComputation(2, 3))
</code></pre>
<p>Here the expression <strong><code>Q</code></strong> is:</p>
<p><strong><em><code>$someCondition() and lazy( $complexComputation(2, 3))</code></em></strong></p>
<p>This  is the same as:</p>
<p><strong><em><code>fn:op("and")($someCondition(), lazy( $complexComputation(2, 3))</code></em></strong></p>
<p>According to the Rules above, the processor converts this to:</p>
<p><strong><em><code>fn:op("and")($someCondition(), ?) (lazy( $complexComputation(2, 3)) )</code></em></strong></p>
<p><code>$someCondition()</code> is evaluated and if its value is <code>false()</code>,   then the expression to be evaluated is:</p>
<p><strong><em><code>fn:op("and")(false(), ?) (lazy( $complexComputation(2, 3)) )</code></em></strong></p>
<p>As <strong><em><code>fn:op("and")(false(), ?)</code></em></strong> by definition is <strong><em><code>function() {false()}</code></em></strong>. then the final result <strong><code>false()</code></strong> is produced and the unnecessary argument <strong><em><code>$complexComputation(2, 3)</code></em></strong> is not evaluated at all.</p>
<h1><strong>III. A function's arity is a guard for its arguments</strong></h1>
<p>Let us have a  function <strong><code>$f</code></strong> defined as below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xq">let $f := function($arg1 as item()*, $arg2 as item()*, …, $argN as item()*)
   as function(item()*, item()*, …, item()*) as item()*
     {
       if($cond0($arg1))       then -&gt; () { 123 }
        else if($cond1($arg1)) then -&gt; ($Z1 as item()*) {$Z1}
        else if($cond2($arg1)) then -&gt; ($Z1 as item()*, $Z2 as item()*) {$Z1 + $Z2}
        (:    .        .        .        .         .        .        .         .  :)
        else if($condK($arg1)) then -&gt; ($Z1 as item()*, $Z2 as item()*, …, $Zk as item()*)
                                       {$Z1 + $Z2 + … + $Zk}
        else ()
     }
  return
     $f($y1, $y2, …, $yN) ($z1, $z2, …, $zk)
</code></pre>
<p>A call to <strong><code>$f</code></strong> returns a function whose arity may be any of the numbers: 0, 1, …, K.</p>
<p>Depending on the arity of the returned function (0, 1, …, K), the last (K, K-1,  K-2, …, 2, 1, 0) arguments of the function call:</p>
<p><strong><em><code>$f($y1, $y2,  .  .  . , $yN) ($z1, $z2, .  .  . , $zk)</code></em></strong></p>
<p><strong>are unneeded and it is logical that they would not need to be evaluated</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>So, the actual arity of the result of calling <strong><code>$f</code></strong> is a guard for the arguments of a call to this function-result</strong>.</p>
<p>Thus, one more bullet needs to be added to [2.4.5 Guarded Expressions] https://qt4cg.org/specifications/xquery-40/xpath-40.html#id-guarded-expressions), specifying an additional guard-type:</p>
<ul>
<li>In an expression of the type <code>E(A1, A2, ..., AN)</code> any of the arguments <code>A</code><sub>K</sub> is guarded by the condition
<code>actual-arity(E) ge K</code>. This rule has the consequence that if the actual arity of <code>E()</code> is less than <code>K</code> then if any argument <code>Am</code> (where <code>m &gt;= K</code>) is evaluated, this must not raise a dynamic error. An implementation may base on the actual arity of <code>E()</code> its decision for the evaluation of the arguments.</li>
</ul>

This would basically treat an array as a map with integer keys.</p>
<p>This would allow a cleaner type signature for map:find() and any future functions such as xx:search() that work both on maps and arrays. It might simplify the description of the lookup operator "?". For functions that already exist in both the map and array namespaces, such as get(), we could introduce a unified function in the fn namespace with the cosmetic benefit of reducing the need for namespace prefixes and namespace declarations.</p>
<p>I'm still keen to find a better way of doing iteration, filtering, mapping, and construction of maps and arrays, and I think this might be a useful stepping stone.</p>
