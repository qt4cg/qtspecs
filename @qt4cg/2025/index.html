<p>We introduce map:sort($m) essentially as a convenient shorthand for <code>map:of-pairs(sort(map:pairs($m), fn{?key}))</code>.</p>
<p>And then we introduce something like <code>map:get-range($from, $to)</code> which returns the keys (or pairs, or entries) whose keys are in a given range -- which the implementation can optimize if it knows the map has been sorted.</p>

Back in 2016 I published a paper at XML Prague (https://www.saxonica.com/papers/xmlprague-2016mhk.pdf) with the rather disappointing result that for a couple of non-trivial JSON transformation tasks, the easiest solution was to convert the JSON to XML, transform the XML, and then convert it back. In many ways it was that discovery that motivated the whole XSLT 4.0 project. So I want to review to what extent we have solved that problem, and what remains to be done. In particular, I have recently raised a number of open issues related to how we transform JSON-derived trees of maps and arrays using template rules, and I'm not sure we can resolve those issues without testing the proposals against real use cases.</p>
<p>I'm proposing to take as a case study the Java-to-C# transpiler which we described in a 2021 paper at https://www.saxonica.com/papers/markupuk-2021mhk.pdf. This is a real XSLT application in daily use. It invokes the (open source) JavaParser to emit an XML representation of Java source code, it performs various transformations of that XML, and then finally spits out equivalent C# source code. My basic question is: suppose the JavaParser had chosen to emit JSON instead of XML (as it might perfectly reasonably have chosen to do). Would we be able to write the transpiler in XSLT 4.0 to work entirely within the JSON space, avoiding all use of XML?</p>
<p>I chose this case study for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's entirely plausible that the input might have been JSON rather than XML</li>
<li>The application relies very heavily (and successfully) on rule-based processing: if we didn't have template rules, then it would be dominated by large xsl:choose statements with hundreds of branches.</li>
<li>At around 5000 lines of XSLT, it's large enough to be non-trivial, yet small enough to be tractable as a case study.</li>
</ul>
<p>I looked at a couple of other candidates, and found they were things that could be readily done in XSLT 3.0 without any enhancements. For example we have production XSLT 3.0 code that takes a JSON data feed from our online shop at saxonica.com and uses it to update our sales database and to generate license keys. The JSON is voluminous but the structure is simple, and the constructs in XSLT 3.0 for handling maps and arrays are entirely up to the job. The transpiler differs in that the JSON has a much more interesting recursive structure, making rule-based transformation a natural fit to the task.</p>
<p>I'm not proposing to actually produce a complete replacement of the current transpiler, only to explore the task of doing so in enough detail to get some useful insights. I propose to use this issue tracker to capture my working notes as the study proceeds, but if there are recommendations affecting the 4.0 specs (as seems likely), then I will extract those into separate issues. Perhaps at the end of the process I will write up the case study as a conference paper.</p>
<p>My rough plan is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Explore conversion of the current XML output by JavaParser to JSON using the new elements-to-maps() function. We have a number of open issues on the usability of this function and it will be interesting to see whether we encounter similar difficulties to those that have already been raised, and whether the suggested solutions are appropriate.</li>
<li>Convert the xml-to-java stylesheet to work on this JSON input. This stylesheet is not actually a working part of the transpiler, rather it's something we built as a stepping stone; before attempting to convert the XML syntax tree to C#, we felt it would be instructive to write code that converted it back to Java. This is an 820-line stylesheet and it should be feasible to convert it completely.</li>
<li>The transpiler currently produces, as an intermediate output, a "digest" file containing summary information about all the classes and methods found in the Java code, and their subtyping/override relationships. We then have a process that augments this digest with attributes that are needed by the C# generation, for example which methods to label with "virtual" or "override" modifiers. I propose to experiment with producing (and transforming) this digest in JSON rather than XML format.</li>
<li>Examine the XSLT code that generates C# output to look for features that appear to be tricky to convert, for example anything that uses the parent or ancestor axis, and study to what extent we now have the capability in XSLT 4.0 to handle those situations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Using this format (a GitHub issue) to record progress carries a risk that there will be comments that take things off at a tangent. Please help by resisting that temptation: if there are interesting issues raised in your mind, please take those up as separate issues.</p>

<h3>1. <code>ArrowExpr</code> target must be optional</h3>
<p>The current definition in the specification is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>ArrowExpr ::= UnaryExpr (SequenceArrowTarget | MappingArrowTarget | LookupArrowTarget)
</code></pre>
<p>However, the target part must at least be optional, or better zero-or-more:</p>
<pre><code>ArrowExpr ::= UnaryExpr (SequenceArrowTarget | MappingArrowTarget | LookupArrowTarget)*
</code></pre>
<p>Otherwise arrow targets are expected almost everywhere. Making it zero-or-more allows parsing of</p>
<pre><code>a =&gt; b() =&gt; c()
</code></pre>
<p>which would not be possible without extra parentheses if it was optional.</p>
<h3>2. Missing <code>preceding-sibling</code> in <code>ReverseAxis</code></h3>
<p>The <code>ReverseAxis</code> production currently appears as:</p>
<pre><code>ReverseAxis ::= ( "ancestor"
                | "ancestor-or-self"
                | "parent"
                | "preceding"
                | "preceding-or-self"
                | "preceding-sibling-or-self" ) "::"
</code></pre>
<p>It is missing the <code>prededing-sibling</code> axis.</p>

<p>I propose that if the contained sequence constructor is non-empty then instead of ignoring it, we should use it to create the content of the new map or array. Specifically, for maps xsl:copy will behave essentially like xsl:map, and for arrays it will behave essentially like xsl:array.</p>
<p>This is an incompatibility with 3.1, but since a contained sequence constructor is currently totally useless in this situation, it doesn't seem likely to cause any trouble.</p>
<p>I also propose that rather than using the new built-in <code>on-no-match="shallow-copy-all</code>, we should extend the semantics of <code>shallow-copy</code> to cover maps and arrays (as currently defined for <code>shallow-copy-all</code>). Again, there is an incompatibility, but the current rules are so unhelpful that it's unlikely people are relying on them.</p>
<p>I also propose that when apply-templates is applied to a map or array, it should be automatically pinned if it is not pinned already. The means that match patterns can be used with a lot more context to match the deep contents of the map or array and override the processing of the built-in templates.</p>
<p>And I propose that when apply-templates is applied to a map or array and there is no <code>select</code> attribute, it should "do the right thing" by applying templates to the map or array contents, rather than using the useless default of <code>child::node()</code>.</p>

P2</code>, where <code>P1</code> and <code>P2</code> are patterns, should match any labelled item $L provided that $L matches P2, and <code>$L?..</code> (that is, <code>($L =&gt; label())?parent</code> ) matches <code>P1</code>.</p>
<p>Similarly, the pattern <code>P1 ?? P2</code>, where <code>P1</code> and <code>P2</code> are patterns, should match any labelled item $L provided that $L matches P2, and <code>$L?...</code> (that is, <code>($L =&gt; label())?ancestors()</code> ) matches <code>P1</code>.</p>
<p>Note that neither the syntax nor the semantics are directly related to the lookup operator in XPath. In particular, P2 is a pattern, not a KeySpecifier. But there is a strong analogy, both with the use of <code>?</code> and <code>??</code> in XPath expressions, and with the use of <code>/</code> and <code>//</code> in patterns.</p>

<p>I propose introducing the key specifier <code>..</code>, with <code>$M?..</code> being a shorthand for <code>($M =&gt; label())?parent</code>, giving a convenient and familiar way to navigate from a j-node to its parent in a pinned tree. For example, <code>$M?..?name</code> gives the value of the <code>name</code> property in the immediately containing map.</p>
<p>Similarly, I propose introducing the key specifier <code>...</code> to navigate to ancestors, so <code>$M?...</code> becomes a shorthand for <code>($M =&gt; label())?ancestors()</code>, and <code>$M?...?name</code> returns the <code>name</code> property of all containing maps.</p>
<p>For symmetry I suggest we also provide <code>...</code> as an abbreviated axis step, short for <code>ancestor::node()</code>.</p>
<p>I'd like to find a better name for "pinned". Perhaps "tracked" better captures that what it does is to track downward navigation steps and make them reversible.</p>
<p>I'd also like to introduce the terms <code>j-tree</code> and <code>j-node</code>. A j-tree is a map or array, recursively expanded to include its entries or members. A j-node is a value in a j-tree. Perhaps confine the usage to maps and arrays that have been pinned/tracked.</p>

This became more complicated with the introduction of <code>xsl:next-match</code> in XSLT 2.0 - what should happen if the item matches both branches? It became more complicated again in XSLT 3.0 with the introduction of <code>on-multiple-match</code> - is it a multiple match if an item matches both branches? And in 4.0 it's complicated further by the introduction of constructs like <code>match="element(A|B)"</code> which is deemed equivalent to <code>match=A|B</code>.</p>
<p>I would like to break this cycle with a backwards-incompatible change. The default priority of a union pattern should be the numeric maximum of the default priorities of its branches; the treatment as being somewhat-equivalent to two separate template rules should go. We should encourage implementations to issue a compatibility warning if a union pattern appears with no explicit priority, and with multiple branches having different default priority.</p>

<p><code>(1 to 5) =!&gt; (xs:double() =&gt; math:sqrt() -&gt; .+1 ) =&gt; sum()</code></p>
<p>because we can't have a parenthesised construct on the RHS of the mapping arrow.</p>
<p>We can use the bang operator but the parentheses are awkward:</p>
<p><code>((1 to 5) ! (xs:double(.) =&gt; math:sqrt() -&gt; (.+1) )) =&gt; sum()</code></p>
<p>If we changed the precedences we could allow</p>
<p><code>(1 to 5) ! xs:double(.) ! math:sqrt(.) ! (.+1)  -&gt; sum(.)</code></p>
<p>Which would require moving <code>-&gt;</code> so it has lower precedence than <code>!</code>. But this would disrupt its relationship with <code>=&gt;</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Allow underscores and whitespace in strings of binary, octal, or hex digits supplied as strings.</li>
<li>Use type <code>xs:unsignedByte</code> rather than xs:integer for octet values</li>
<li>Use an enum type for params like "little-endian".</li>
</ul>
<p>The following are some suggested copy-edits:</p>
<p>Abstract para 4 - link to XQuery 4.1. The last sentence of the para ("The signatures and summaries of functions defined in this document...") makes no sense.</p>
<p>1.1 para 1, twice, ".)" should be ").".</p>
<p>1.2 Mention that the coercion rules in 4.0 mean that wherever a function accepts xs:base64Binary, it also accepts xs:hexBinary (but we've changed the signature to allow either, anyway).</p>
<p>para 2. " if the result return"?</p>
<p>The Note is ineleganty worded.</p>
<p>1.3 I guess we should integrate the test suite into QT4.</p>
<p>1.5 para 2 "In accordance with current practice" eh?</p>
<p>2.1 Example would benefit from reformatting.</p>
<p>2.2 Example, similarly. Could use underscores in the long integers. "and the examples from above reverse"??</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>"fn:fn:binary-resource" does not yet exist and is triple-barrelled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid "apologetic quotes" in 'constants'. And elsewhere. If it doesn't work as plain English without quotes, then it needs to be a defined term.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>4.1 and throughout, in Examples, use the F&amp;O rendition rather than the right arrow. Also, add these functions to the example checking mechanism.</p>
<p>4.1 Notes, be more precise than "similarly". Define formal equivalent. Non-editorial enhancement: allow underscores in the string.</p>
<p>4.2 There must be a more elegant way of saying "(8-wise) (ASCII) binary digits ([01])". Allow underscores.</p>
<p>4.2 "a xs:base64Binary with no embedded data" - use the term "zero-length".</p>
<p>4.3 similarly. Allow underscores.</p>
<p>Function properties: I think all these functions are pure functions so it's a waste of space to say this explicitly for each function.</p>
<p>4.4, 4.5 Use <code>xs:unsignedByte</code> to represent octets now that we have implicit downcasting. (Changes error code [[bin:octet-out-of-range]to XPTY0004).</p>
<p>5.6 "blank octets"?</p>
<p>7.1.2 "or assumed to be represented"</p>
<p>7.1.3 "Care should be taken" - what does this mean?</p>
<p>"Positive and negative infinities are supported" - who or what is doing the supporting?</p>
<p>Use underscore rather than space as separators between digits.</p>
<p>'quiet' NaN - avoid apologetic quotes.</p>
<p>7.4 - I find the note regarding signed/unsigned integers very confusing.</p>
<p>8.1: "bitwise or" - avoid apologetic quotes. For these three functions we should say what they do rather than assuming the reader will guess from the names. bin:shift could do with more precision. Perhaps the functions could be explained more formally by a mapping from a binary value to a sequence of booleans, then for example bin:and becomes something like for-each-pair(op:from-bits($a), op:from-bits($b), op('and') ) =&gt; op:to-bits().</p>
<p>8.5: avoid the notation <code>|$by|</code> for absolute value. Not all of us remember our schooldays. (And when I was at school, <code>by</code> meant <code>b × y</code>, and $ meant dollars.)</p>

<p>I did make a couple of executive decisions.</p>
<p>The use of "..." as the target to click on didn't seem like a practical affordance. It's not a common use of ellipsis and it looked too much like it simply meant that part of the title was elided. I went with right and down triangles instead. And I added the few lines of JS required to make them "turn".</p>
<p>I added a top-level expand/collapse that does all of the sections. I wasn't happy that with the new UI, there was no way to get an overview of the document by seeing all of the section titles.</p>
<p>I tinkered with the CSS. I'm not uniformly happy with it, especially with the treatment of long titles, but I think the aesthetic failings are infrequent.</p>
<p>We need to review accessibility before we try to publish as a CG Report.</p>

The ordering of such a map should be implementation-dependent, in order to allow construction in parallel threads.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I think that an xsl:map instruction used in this way should probably not allow duplicate keys. In principle we could collect key/value pairs during the streamed processing and then resolve duplicates at the end, but it's extra complexity.</p>

<p>If retain-option=false is specified, the user declares to the processor that they don't require the resulting map to be in any particular order. An implementation is of course free to ignore this and deliver an ordered map anyway, but if the implementation can save time or space by not retaining order then it is free to do so.</p>
<p>I propose to provide some data quantifying the potential benefits of this option. I realise that some optimisation hints provided in the past, for example the <code>unordered{}</code> expression, have been ineffective, but I think there is a difference here because changing maps to be ordered may result in a performance regression for people moving from 3.1 to 4.0.</p>

$position argument to the callback of many higher-order functions such as some(), every(), filter(), for-each(), fold-left(), fold-right(). Instead, it provides the option to wrap the input sequence in a call of numbered-items() which replaces each item in the input with an (item, position) pair.</p>
<p>I've done this only (so far) for higher-order sequence functions, but the intent is that the same could be done for arrays and (potentially) maps.</p>
<p>I left the position argument in place for a few functions where losing it seemed to cause genuine inconvenience:</p>
<ul>
<li>partition(), where the function wraps the supplied items into arrays, and you don't want to have to remove the positions afterwards</li>
<li>subsequence-where(), where many use cases are likely to use positional information</li>
<li>for-each-pair(), where there are two input sequences and it seems clumsy to associate position information with one or the other</li>
</ul>
<p>The main benefit is that we provide one basic mechanism which is automatically available everywhere, which means we don't have to have debates about whether or not there is a use case for adding position information to (say) fold-left or scan-right.</p>
<p>A further benefit is that the functions defined for sequences automatically become available for arrays and maps. I haven't yet explored the impact on maps and arrays; I will wait first to see what the reaction is to this proposal.</p>

It says clearly what entry should be created for the duplicated key, but it doesn't say clearly where this entry should appear in the result.</p>
<p>There are four functions/instructions that this applies to: map:merge, map:build, map:of-pairs, and xsl:map.</p>
<p>I propose that in each case, the position of the entry for the duplicated key in the resulting map should correspond to the position of the first occurrence of that key in the input sequence. That is, "order of first appearance": the effect should be the same as if new entries are always created using a map:put() operation.</p>
<p>This might be slightly unexpected in the case of <code>map:merge()</code> with the option <code>duplicates=use-last</code>. It means the value will be that of the last duplicate, but its position will be that of the first duplicate. However, the other three functions/instructions achieve the effect of use-last with the callback <code>on-duplicates=fn{$a, $b){$a}</code> which only controls the value of the entry, and cannot be used to control its position, and I think it makes sense for <code>map:merge</code> with <code>duplicates=use-last</code> to behave in the same way.</p>
<p>Of course we could introduce a separate option to control the position of the combined entry, but I think that would be overkill. <code>xsl:for-each-group</code> and <code>distinct-values</code> both use the "order of first appearance" rule and this has never caused any problems. (<code>group-by</code> in XQuery delivers groups in implementation-dependent order, however).</p>

The unused namespace was used on a single attribute on the input document, but I’m removing the attribute entirely as part of the transformation, so nothing will remain in the output document that uses the namespace in question. With <code>&lt;xsl:mode on-no-match="shallow-copy"/&gt;</code> the namespace declaration is copied into the result, even though it is not used. If I use the old identity template and set the value of <code>@copy-namespaces</code> on it to something falsy, I get the result I want, that is, no unneeded namespace declaration.</p>
<p>Insofar as <code>&lt;xsl:mode on-no-match="shallow-copy"/&gt;</code> has come to fill the role formerly occupied by the identity template, would it be reasonable to allow it also to declare that unused namespaces should not be copied? If that request is reasonable, is it reasonable to think of it as a bug fix, rather than a new-feature request?</p>

<p>Along with this there has been a fair bit of deletion of legacy code and general modernisation (e.g using XSLT 2.0 and 3.0 constructs where appropriate).</p>

This issue is raised to capture some observations and suggestions about how it can be simplified.</p>
<ul>
<li>The DTD lists 19 attributes that can appear on g:token, and documents the meaning of 5 of them (very briefly). I suspect that many of the attributes are never used. Many of them were probably intended primarily for use by the JavaCC parser generator.</li>
<li>As if that weren't enough, the grammar2spec stylesheet has logic that looks for additional attributes (an example is <code>@alias-for</code>) which are not even allowed by the DTD let alone being in active use.</li>
<li>The "if" logic to assign productions to different languages (xpath, xquery, XSLT patterns) is hard to maintain and could be automated: just search for productions that are reachable from the top-level production for each language. This could be done by a preprocessing stylesheet that generates a grammar file for each language.</li>
<li>The switch into a precedence-based grammar for binary operators (g:exprProduction name="OperatorExpr") doesn't really help anyone. For generating production rules in the spec, it just complicates the generation logic. The same is true for anyone else writing applications that use the grammar as input. It doesn't really make life easier for maintainers of the grammar, because it means there is more to learn.</li>
</ul>
<p>All the JavaCC machinery is still in the repo and I think it could probably go. Leaving stuff like that lying around makes things more difficult when you need to search filestore for references to things.</p>

There's a lot of dead code. Some of it might come in useful in the future (e.g. code supporting XQuery Update) but most will be very hard to revive. For example there's a lot of grammar machinery which is there only to allow generation of a JavaCC parser.</p>
<p>The main purpose of this issue is to capture notes that might lead to some reduction of technical debt.</p>
<p>The gradle build is currently giving me</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Warning: link-text-with-check was unable to make a link for $ref-id="doc-shared40-Prolog"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That message comes from <code>xmlspec-override.xsl</code>. This stylesheet looks like dead code because it has lots of references to XPath30 and XQuery30. But it can't be completely dead if we're getting errors from it. It's imported from two places: xpath-functions-30.xsl in the F&amp;O tree and shared.xsl in the xquery40 tree. The message comes from gradle task <code>xquery_shared_html</code>. As far as I can see the build system is constructing an XPath specification, an XQuery specification, and a "shared" specification which is a union of the two. (It starts off "XQuery 4.0 and XPath 4.0 is an expression language that allows..."). Presumably this was intended to allow editors and WG members to review a single document rather than reviewing XPath and XQuery separately. But I don't think it's used today, I think we could kill it off.</p>
<p>shared.xsl is referenced only from build.gradle when building the shared specification.</p>
<p>xpath-functions-30.xsl doesn't appear to be referenced from anywhere, and it carries a comment saying</p>
<pre><code> Created 17 Dec 2008 by MHK.
 No longer used 16 Feb 2009?
</code></pre>
<p>In the short term I've deleted the code in xmlspec-override.xsl starting with the comment "Our inability to create a link for $ref-id may be a sign of something wrong, so...". This gets rid of the warning messages. In the longer term, subject to confirmation, I think we can delete the build targets associated with the "shared" language spec, and delete the stylesheets xmlspec-override.xsl, xpath-functions-30.xsl, and shared.xsl.</p>

<pre><code>ArrowTarget

ArrowStaticFunction
         ::= EQName
ArrowDynamicFunction
         ::= VarRef
           | InlineFunctionExpr
           | ParenthesizedExpr 
</code></pre>
<p>This complicates the distinction of the static and dynamic variants of <code>ArrowTarget</code>, as it cannot be done with a fixed number of lookahead tokens. E.g. in an expression starting like this</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">A =&gt; fn ( $A, $B, $C, (: ... :) $Z ) { } ( 
</code></pre>
<p>the distinction cannot be made before the left brace is seen. While constructing an LR parser, there is a shift-reduce conflict between shifting <code>fn</code> as a keyword of an <code>InlineFunctionExpr</code>, or reducing <code>fn</code> to the <code>QName</code> of <code>EQName</code>.</p>
<p>This can easily be fixed by adding <code>xgc: reserved-function-names</code> to <code>ArrowStaticFunction</code>, which would also be consistent with other function calls in disallowing reserved function names:</p>
<pre><code>ArrowStaticFunction
         ::= EQName
                          /* xgc: reserved-function-names */

<p>But could not <code>ArrowTarget</code> also be written like the following?</p>
<pre><code>ArrowTarget
         ::= FunctionCall
           | DynamicFunctionCall
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, the <code>xgc: reserved-function-names</code> constraint would be inherited from <code>FunctionCall</code>. It eliminates <code>ArrowStaticFunction</code> and <code>ArrowDynamicFunction</code> and at the same time lifts some restrictions imposed by the current <code>ArrowTarget</code>. It does not cause any LALR(2) conflicts.</p>

<p>I guess that #832 would have been the PR with the relevant changes (we have already observed in another issue that some changes of this PR need to survive; see https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/pull/1283#issuecomment-2568330191).</p>
<p>That leads me to the original reason for creating this issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>I think it’s a good idea to drop the range check for array lookups, and it would seem consistent to me to also drop it for dynamic function calls.</li>
<li>As map/array lookups and dynamic function calls are often used interchangeably, <code>$array?0</code> and <code>$array(0)</code> should behave identically.</li>
<li>The <code>FOAY0001</code> error would (and should) still be raised by the array functions, including <code>array:get</code>, <code>array:put</code>, <code>array:remove</code>, or <code>array:insert-before</code>.</li>

<p>It's easy enough to correct this by hand, but it would be nice to prevent this happening by automating the generation of these families of grammar rules, perhaps by including all rules in the subtree up to a depth of 3, say.

<pre><code class="language-xquery">if (A) then if (B) {C} else if (D) {E} else if (F) {G} else {H}
</code></pre>
<p>It can be parsed like this</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">if (A) then if (B) {C}                               else {}
       else if (D) {E} else if (F) {G} else {H}

<p>The corresponding part of the grammar is</p>
<pre><code>IfExpr   ::= 'if' '(' Expr ')' ( UnbracedActions | BracedActions )
UnbracedActions

<p>XQuery Update is complex, as updates are in general, so we may still decide that it is too ambitious to introduce update features in the core language. If we want to give it a try, we could offer functions that are based on XQUF, but that only perform one update operation at a a time on a given input. This way, we could ignore the sophisticated <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-update-30/#id-pending-update-lists">Pending Update List</a> semantics, which is only important when multiple updating expressions are specified and need to be checked and brought into order.</p>
<p>A function set that provides an equivalent functionality for all XQUF update operations could look as follows (the presented functions are valid XQuery Update code):</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">declare namespace update = 'http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-update';

declare function update:delete(
  $node  as node(),
  $path  as fn(node()) as node()*
) as node() {
  copy $c := $node
  modify delete node $path($c)
  return $c
};

declare function update:rename(
  $node  as node(),
  $path  as fn(node()) as node()*,
  $name  as (xs:QName | xs:NCName | fn(node(), xs:integer) as (xs:QName | xs:NCName))
) as node() {
  copy $c := $node
  modify (
    for $target at $pos in $path($c)
    let $result := if($name instance of fn(*)) {
      $name($target, $pos)
    } else {
      $name
    }
    return rename node $target as $result
  )
  return $c
};

declare function update:replace(
  $node      as node(),
  $path      as fn(node()) as node()*,
  $contents  as (node() | xs:anyAtomicType | fn(node(), xs:integer) as node()*)*,
  $options   as record(value? as xs:boolean)? := {}
) as node() {
  copy $c := $node
  modify (
    for $target at $pos in $path($c)
    let $result := (
      for $content in $contents
      return if($content instance of fn(*)) {
        $content($target, $pos)
      } else {
        $content
      }
    )
    return if($options?value) {
      replace value of node $target with $result
    } else {
      replace node $target with $result
    }
  )
  return $c
};

declare function update:insert(
  $node      as node(),
  $path      as fn(node()) as node()*,
  $contents  as (node() | xs:anyAtomicType | fn(node(), xs:integer) as (node() | xs:anyAtomicType))*,
  $options   as record(position? as enum('last', 'first', 'before', 'after'))? := {}
) as node() {
  copy $c := $node
  modify (
    for $target at $pos in $path($c)
    let $result := (
      for $content in $contents
      return if($content instance of fn(*)) {
        $content($target, $pos)
      } else {
        $content
      }
    )
    return switch($options?position) {
      case 'before' return insert node $result before $target
      case 'after'  return insert node $result after $target
      case 'first'  return insert node $result as first into $target
      default       return insert node $result as last into $target
    }
  )
  return $c
};
</code></pre>
<p>Here are some exemplary function calls:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">let $node := &lt;xml&gt;&lt;e/&gt;&lt;e/&gt;&lt;/xml&gt;
return (
  (: deletes all &lt;e/&gt; child nodes :)
  update:delete($node, fn { e }),
  (: renames the &lt;e/&gt; child nodes to &lt;f/&gt; :)
  update:rename($node, fn { e }, 'f'),
  (: replaces the &lt;e/&gt; child nodes with &lt;replaced/&gt; :)
  update:replace($node, fn { e }, &lt;replaced/&gt;),
  (: replaces the string value of the &lt;e/&gt; child nodes with 'text' :)
  update:replace($node, fn { e }, 'text', { 'value': true() }),
  (: inserts a 'text' text node into the &lt;e/&gt; child nodes :)
  update:insert($node, fn { e }, 'text'),
  (: inserts 'text1' and 'text2' text nodes into the &lt;e/&gt; child nodes :)
  update:insert($node, fn { e }, fn($node, $pos) { 'text' || $pos }),
  (: inserts an &lt;x/&gt; element after each &lt;e/&gt; child node :)
  update:insert($node, fn { e }, &lt;x/&gt;, { 'position': 'after' })
)
</code></pre>
<p>Multiple update operations can easily be chained:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">(: rename &lt;e/&gt; child nodes to &lt;f/&gt;, insert 'x' text nodes :)
&lt;xml&gt;&lt;e/&gt;&lt;e/&gt;&lt;/xml&gt;
=&gt; update:rename(fn { e }, 'f')
=&gt; update:insert(fn { f }, 'x')
</code></pre>
<p>Ideally, we could offer a similar function set (or maybe even the same) for maps and arrays in a next step (see #77). The map/array syntax would be similar for deletions…</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">let $data := { 'a': [ 1, 2, 3 ] }
return update:delete($data, fn { ?a?2 })
</code></pre>
<p>…but it certainly gets trickier for other operations.</p>
<p>If some of you believe that the presented approach is something that we should pursue, I will be happy to add details. As an alternative, we could pursue the XQUF light approach that I have sketched in #1225, based on the existing XQUF update keywords.</p>
<p>Yet another solution could be to stick with what we have, but add map/array update features to XQUF.</p>

Having written a dedication, there's a follow-up question of where to put it. Having it in only one specification isn't wrong, but it seems slightly odd given that MSM contributed to them all. In the end, I decided to put a full dedication in the XPath specification and link to it from the others.</p>
<p>My rationale for the XPath spec is that it's probaly one that everyone reads. Another possibility was the Data Model as it's "foundational" but I think it's less read than XPath.</p>
<p>The published PR won't be write because there are tooling changes required. I've attached a couple of screen shots, one of the full dedication in XPath:</p>

I hope this is the right place here for my proposal.
And even though I did some search -- I am not sure if something similar was discussed before ...</p>
<p>I propose to allow a <code>select</code> attribute for <code>xsl:call-template</code> instructions. When the <code>select</code> attribute is set, then the named template is called for each selected item as context item.</p>
<p>When the empty sequence is selected, the template is not invoked.</p>
<p>When the <code>select</code> attribute is omitted, then the instruction works as before (Invoked once and <em>"[...] does not change focus [...]"</em>).</p>
<p>For extension instructions from named templates: May work the same with a prefixed attribute (e.g. <code>xsl:select</code>).</p>
<p>Benefits I see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the context without <code>xsl:apply-templates</code></li>
<li>Avoid template parameter with <code>current()</code> as default value (annoying when you have nested named template calls)</li>
<li>Avoid <code>xsl:for-each</code> workaround where context just must be adjusted for a single item (no such parameter available, see before)</li>
<li>Save an <code>xsl:for-each</code> instruction with this shorter form</li>
<li>Harmonize <code>xsl:call-template</code> with <code>xsl:apply-templates</code> concept a little bit</li>
</ul>
<p>Simple example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;xsl:template match="elem"&gt;
  &lt;xsl:call-template name="t:make-something" select="child-elem"/&gt;
  &lt;!-- ... or as extension instruction: --&gt;
  &lt;t:make-something xsl:select="child-elem"/&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;

&lt;xsl:template name="t:make-something"&gt;
  &lt;xsl:context-item use="required" as="element(child-elem)"&gt;
  &lt;!-- ... --&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The call of <code>t:make-something</code> before is equivalent with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;xsl:template match="elem"&gt;
  &lt;xsl:for-each select="child-elem"&gt;
    &lt;xsl:call-template name="t:make-something"/&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;
</code></pre>

It serves as a summary for an upcoming PR.</p>
<p>We have two operators in the language that can be used for pipelining:
&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;With the simple map operator <code>!</code>, single items of an input can be bound to the context value.
&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;With the arrow operator <code>=&gt;</code>, an input can be bound as first argument in a function call.</p>
<p>The current restrictions are:
&nbsp;&nbsp;A) There is no way to bind a sequence with 0 or more than 1 items to the context value.
&nbsp;&nbsp;B) We can only bind the input to the first function argument.</p>
<p>In addition, we have introduced the mapping arrow expression <code>=!&gt;</code> to bind single items of an input to the first function argument.</p>
<p>We could generalize and simplify the situation by introducing a dedicated and very basic pipeline operator: <code>A -&gt; B</code> evaluates <code>A</code> to a value, which is bound to the context value before evaluating <code>B</code>.</p>
<p>With the operator, restriction A) would be resolved. Restriction B) would be tackled indirectly, as <code>-&gt;</code> and <code>!</code> can often be combined. For example, the following examples from the specification could be simplified…</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">(: current vs. simplified syntax :)
$s =&gt; tokenize() =!&gt; fn { `"{.}"` }()
$s -&gt; tokenize(.) ! `"{.}"`

(: current vs. simplified syntax :)
(1 to 5) =!&gt; xs:double() =!&gt; math:sqrt() =!&gt; fn($a) { $a + 1 }() =&gt; sum()
(1 to 5) ! xs:double(.) ! math:sqrt(.) ! (. + 1) -&gt; sum(.)
</code></pre>
<p>…and we could drop <code>=!&gt;</code> in favor of the new operator.</p>
<p>An equivalent representation for the focus function <code>fn { E }</code> would be <code>fn($c) { $c -&gt; E }</code>.</p>

<p>No immediate problem, except (1) we should acknowledge the fact and point out that composite merge keys are now allowed, and (2) the effect on the current-merge-key() function. This is the sequence-concatenation of the merge keys for multiple merge sources. The spec says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the [current merge key] will be a single atomic item if there is a single merge key, or a sequence of atomic items if there are multiple merge keys.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually I think that's already wrong, because it forgets that an individual merge key may be an empty sequence. If that happens then the current-merge-key() function is somewhat useless. I suggest we simply document the fact: if there are multiple merge sources generating multiple merge keys and they are not all singletons, then the sequence concatenation of the merge keys may not be especially useful.</p>
<p>We could provide a variant current-merge-key-array() that returns an array of sort key values, one for each xsl:merge-key element, each one being a sequence of atomic items.</p>

<p>Firstly, the coercion rules no longer invoke type promotion; instead, they use a custom table of "implicit casts". So B.1 is wrong to say that type promotion is invoked by the coercion rules.</p>
<p>Secondly, for selecting an entry in the operator mapping table, I don't think type promotion comes into play.</p>
<ul>
<li>The rules for value comparisons do all the necessary type conversions of operands BEFORE invoking a search of the operator mapping table.</li>
<li>The rules for arithmetic operators don't require any type promotion: for numerics, they invoke a function such as op:numeric-add, and it is the definition of this function (not the selection of the function in the mapping table) that invokes type promotion.</li>
</ul>
<p>The statement in B.1 that "If the result type of an operator is listed as numeric, it means "the first type in the ordered list (xs:integer, xs:decimal, xs:float, xs:double) into which all operands can be converted by [subtype substitution] and [type promotion]" seems wrong in general: for example it doesn't cover <code>integer div integer</code>. The result type is actually defined by the rules of the selected function, e.g. op:numeric-divide, and not by the "result type" column of the operator mapping table. Perhaps it should say that if the result type is a subtype of numeric as defined by the particular function.</p>
<p>References to Type Promotion in F&amp;O section 1.6 are also outdated.</p>
<p>The sum() and avg() functions invoke "numeric promotion" to convert all values in the input to a common type, but the exact rules for doing this aren't exactly clear. For example, the equivalent expression given for sum() doesn't do what the prose says. For example, given sum() applied to a sequence (X as decimal, Y as decimal, Z as float), the prose says the result is float(X) + float(Y) + Z, whereas the equivalent expression gives float(decimal(X + Y)) + Z) which is not necessarily the same thing.</p>

This means you will never get a match if T is a union type.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if T is a complex type, there is no match if the type annotation is a complex type derived by extension from T.</p>
<p>I think this is a simple error in the spec. It should say that derived-from(A, T) must be true. The derived-from() relationship handles union types and derivation by extension correctly.</p>
<p>We do use <code>derived-from</code> when specifying subtyping. This means that an element E can be an instance of <code>element(E, xs:integer)</code>, and not be an instance of <code>element(E, xs:numeric)</code>, even though  <code>element(E, xs:integer)</code>, is a subtype of <code>element(E, xs:numeric)</code>.</p>
<p>The error seems to have crept in when the rules were redrafted for 4.0. Up to and including 3.1, the semantics of ElementTest and AttributeTest reference the derived-from() function.</p>

<p>A while ago, the <code>items</code> key specifier was introduced to mimic the classical wildcard lookup syntax (making <code>$A?*</code> and <code>$A?items::*</code> equivalent), and I suggest renaming our functions to <code>array:items</code> and <code>map:items</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">  $map?*
≍ map:items($map)

  $array?*
≍ array:items($array)

<p>Plan&nbsp;B could be to extend the second argument of <code>map:get</code> (and <code>array:get</code>) to also accept predicate functions…</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">map:get(
  $map  as map(*),	
  $key  as (xs:anyAtomicType|fn(xs:anyAtomicType) as xs:boolean?)
) as item()*
</code></pre>
<p>…which would allow us to write:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">  $map?a
≍ $map =&gt; map:get('a')
≍ $map =&gt; map:get(fn { . = 'a' })

  $map?(1 to 5)
≍ $map =&gt; map:get(fn { . = 1 to 5 })

  $map?*
≍ $map =&gt; map:get(true#0)

(: and things like :)
$map =&gt; map:get(fn { . mod 2 = 1 })
